  abstract = {In particle collider experiments, elementary particle interactions with large momentum transfer produce quarks and gluons (known as partons) whose evolution is governed by the strong force, as described by the theory of quantum chromodynamics (QCD)1. These partons subsequently emit further partons in a process that can be described as a parton shower2, which culminates in the formation of detectable hadrons. Studying the pattern of the parton shower is one of the key experimental tools for testing QCD. This pattern is expected to depend on the mass of the initiating parton, through a phenomenon known as the dead-cone effect, which predicts a suppression of the gluon spectrum emitted by a heavy quark of mass mQ and energy E, within a cone of angular size mQ/E around the emitter3. Previously, a direct observation of the dead-cone effect in QCD had not been possible, owing to the challenge of reconstructing the cascading quarks and gluons from the experimentally accessible hadrons. We report the direct observation of the QCD dead cone by using new iterative declustering techniques4,5 to reconstruct the parton shower of charm quarks. This result confirms a fundamental feature of QCD. Furthermore, the measurement of a dead-cone angle constitutes a direct experimental observation of the non-zero mass of the charm quark, which is a fundamental constant in the standard model of particle physics.},

  abstract = {The production of {$\Lambda$} baryons and KS0 mesons (V0 particles) was measured in p\textendash Pb collisions at sNN=5.02 TeV and pp collisions at s=7 TeV with ALICE at the LHC. The production of these strange particles is studied separately for particles associated with hard scatterings and the underlying event to shed light on the baryon-to-meson ratio enhancement observed at intermediate transverse momentum (pT) in high multiplicity pp and p\textendash Pb collisions. Hard scatterings are selected on an event-by-event basis with jets reconstructed with the anti-kT algorithm using charged particles. The production of strange particles associated with jets pT,jetch{$>$}10 and pT,jetch{$>$}20 GeV/c in p\textendash Pb collisions, and with jet pT,jetch{$>$}10 GeV/c in pp collisions is reported as a function of pT. Its dependence on angular distance from the jet axis, R(V0,jet), for jets with pT,jetch{$>$}10 GeV/c in p\textendash Pb collisions is reported as well. The pT-differential production spectra of strange particles associated with jets are found to be harder compared to that in the underlying event and both differ from the inclusive measurements. In events containing a jet, the density of the V0 particles in the underlying event is found to be larger than the density in the minimum bias events. The {$\Lambda$}/KS0 ratio associated with jets in p\textendash Pb collisions is consistent with the ratio in pp collisions and follows the expectation of jets fragmenting in vacuum. On the other hand, this ratio within jets is consistently lower than the one obtained in the underlying event and it does not show the characteristic enhancement of baryons at intermediate pT often referred to as ``baryon anomaly'' in the inclusive measurements.},

  abstract = {We review the most important experimental results from the first three years of nucleus\textendash nucleus collision studies at RHIC, with emphasis on results from the STAR experiment, and we assess their interpretation and comparison to theory. The theory-experiment comparison suggests that central Au\,+\,Au collisions at RHIC produce dense, rapidly thermalizing matter characterized by: (1) initial energy densities above the critical values predicted by lattice QCD for establishment of a quark\textendash gluon plasma (QGP); (2) nearly ideal fluid flow, marked by constituent interactions of very short mean free path, established most probably at a stage preceding hadron formation; and (3) opacity to jets. Many of the observations are consistent with models incorporating QGP formation in the early collision stages, and have not found ready explanation in a hadronic framework. However, the measurements themselves do not yet establish unequivocal evidence for a transition to this new form of matter. The theoretical treatment of the collision evolution, despite impressive successes, invokes a suite of distinct models, degrees of freedom and assumptions of as yet unknown quantitative consequence. We pose a set of important open questions, and suggest additional measurements, at least some of which should be addressed in order to establish a compelling basis to conclude definitively that thermalized, deconfined quark\textendash gluon matter has been produced at RHIC.},

The measurements are performed in multiple centrality intervals at mid-rapidity (|\$y\$|{$<$}0.5) in the transverse-momentum ranges 0.3 {$<$} \$p\_\{\textbackslash rm T\}\$ {$<$} 5 GeV/\$c\$ for the K*(892)\$\^\{0\}\$ and 0.5 {$<$} \$p\_\{\textbackslash rm T\}\$ {$<$} 5 GeV/\$c\$ for the \$\textbackslash Phi\$(1020). The yields of K*(892)\$\^\{0\}\$ are suppressed in central Pb-Pb collisions with respect to pp and peripheral Pb-Pb collisions (perhaps due to rescattering of its decay products in the hadronic medium), while the longer lived \$\textbackslash Phi\$(1020) meson is not suppressed. These particles are also used as probes to study the mechanisms of particle production. The shape of the \$p\_\{\textbackslash rm T\}\$ distribution of the \$\textbackslash Phi\$(1020) meson, but not its yield, is reproduced fairly well by hydrodynamic models for central Pb-Pb collisions. In central Pb-Pb collisions at low and intermediate \$p\_\{\textbackslash rm T\}\$, the p/\$\textbackslash Phi\$(1020) ratio is flat in \$p\_\{\textbackslash rm T\}\$, while the p/\$\textbackslash pi\$ and \$\textbackslash Phi\$(1020)/\$\textbackslash pi\$ ratios show a pronounced increase and have similar shapes to each other. These results indicate that the shapes of the \$p\_\{\textbackslash rm T\}\$ distributions of these particles in central Pb-Pb collisions are determined predominantly by the particle masses and radial flow. Finally, \$\textbackslash Phi\$(1020) production in Pb-Pb collisions is enhanced, with respect to the yield in pp collisions and the yield of charged pions, by an amount similar to the \$\textbackslash Lambda\$ and \$\textbackslash Xi\$.},

  abstract = {The ALICE experiment was proposed in 1993, to study strongly interacting matter at extreme energy densities via a comprehensive investigation of nuclear collisions at the LHC. Its physics programme initially focused on the determination of the properties of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP), a deconfined state of quarks and gluons and was extended along the years, covering a diverse ensemble of observables related to Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), the theory of strong interactions. The experiment has studied Pb-Pb, Xe-Xe, p-Pb and pp collisions in the multi-TeV energy range, during the Run 1 and Run 2 data taking periods at the LHC (2009-2018). The aim of this review article is to gather and summarise a selection of ALICE physics results and to discuss their implications on the current understanding of the macroscopic and microscopic properties of strongly interacting matter at the highest temperature reached in the laboratory. It will be shown that it is possible to have a quantitative description of the properties of the QGP produced in Pb--Pb collisions. We also show that various features, commonly ascribed to QGP formation, are detected for a wide range of interacting system sizes. Precision measurements of QCD-related observables not directly connected to the study of the QGP will also be discussed. Prospects for future measurements with the ALICE detector and its foreseen upgrades will also be briefly described.},

In the low transverse momentum (\$p\_\{\textbackslash mathrm\{T\}\}\$) region, \$p\_\{\textbackslash mathrm\{T\}\} {$<$} 2 \$GeV/\$c\$, \$v\_2(p\_\textbackslash mathrm\{T\})\$ exhibits a particle mass dependence consistent with elliptic flow accompanied by the transverse radial expansion of the system with a common velocity field. The experimental data for \$\textbackslash pi\^\{\textbackslash pm\}\$ and \$\textbackslash mathrm\{K\}\$ are described fairly well by hydrodynamical calculations coupled to a hadronic cascade model (VISHNU) for central collisions. However, the same calculations fail to reproduce the \$v\_2(p\_\textbackslash mathrm\{T\})\$ for p+\$\textbackslash overline\{\textbackslash mathrm\{p\}\}\$, \$\textbackslash mathrm\{\textbackslash phi\}\$, \$\textbackslash Lambda\$+\$\textbackslash overline\{\textbackslash mathrm\{\textbackslash Lambda\}\}\$ and \$\textbackslash Xi\^-\$+\$\textbackslash overline\{\textbackslash Xi\}\^+\$. For transverse momentum values larger than about 3 GeV/\$c\$, particles tend to group according to their type, i.e. mesons and baryons. However, the experimental data at the LHC exhibit deviations from the number of constituent quark (NCQ) scaling at the level of \$\textbackslash pm\$20\$\textbackslash\%\$ for \$p\_\{\textbackslash mathrm\{T\}\} {$>$} 3 \$GeV/\$c\$.},

We show that the triangular flow can be described in terms of the initial spatial anisotropy and its fluctuations, which provides strong constraints on its origin. In the most central events, where the elliptic flow \$v\_2\$ and \$v\_3\$ have similar magnitude, a double peaked structure in the two-particle azimuthal correlations is observed, which is often interpreted as a Mach cone response to fast partons. We show that this structure can be naturally explained from the measured anisotropic flow Fourier coefficients.},

An ordering of the coefficients \$v\_2 {$>$} v\_3 {$>$} v\_4\$ is found in pp and p-Pb collisions, similar to that seen in large collision systems, while a weak \$v\_2\$ multiplicity dependence is observed relative to nucleus-nucleus collisions in the same multiplicity range. Using a novel subevent method, \$v\_\{2\}\$ measured with four-particle cumulants is found to be compatible with that from six-particle cumulants in pp and p-Pb collisions. The magnitude of the correlation between \$v\_n\^2\$ and \$v\_m\^2\$, evaluated with the symmetric cumulants SC\$(m,n)\$ is observed to be positive at all multiplicities for \$v\_2\$ and \$v\_4\$, while for \$v\_2\$ and \$v\_3\$ it is negative and changes sign for multiplicities below 100, which may indicate a different \$v\_n\$ fluctuation pattern in this multiplicity range. The observed long-range multi-particle azimuthal correlations in high multiplicity pp and p-Pb collisions can neither be described by PYTHIA 8 nor by IP-Glasma+MUSIC+UrQMD model calculations, and hence provide new insights into the understanding of collective effects in small collision systems.},

In order to avoid auto-correlation biases, the actual transverse momentum (\$p\_\{\textbackslash rm\{T\}\}\$) spectra of the particles under study and the event activity are measured in different rapidity windows. In the highest multiplicity class, the charged-particle density reaches about 3.5 times the value measured in inelastic collisions. While the yield of protons normalized to pions remains approximately constant as a function of multiplicity, the corresponding ratios of strange hadrons to pions show a significant enhancement that increases with increasing strangeness content. Furthermore, all identified particle to pion ratios are shown to depend solely on charged-particle multiplicity density, regardless of system type and collision energy. The evolution of the spectral shapes with multiplicity and hadron mass shows patterns that are similar to those observed in p-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions at LHC energies. The obtained \$p\_\{\textbackslash rm\{T\}\}\$ distributions and yields are compared to expectations from QCD-based pp event generators as well as to predictions from thermal and hydrodynamic models. These comparisons indicate that traces of a collective, equilibrated system are already present in high-multiplicity pp collisions.},

The increase is found to be more pronounced for hadrons with a larger strangeness content. Possible auto-correlations between the charged particles and the strange hadrons are evaluated by measuring the event-activity with charged particle multiplicity estimators covering different pseudorapidity regions. When comparing to lower energy results, the yields of strange hadrons are found to depend only on the mid-rapidity charged particle multiplicity. Several features of the data are reproduced qualitatively by general purpose QCD Monte Carlo models that take into account the effect of densely-packed QCD strings in high multiplicity collisions. However, none of the tested models reproduce the data quantitatively. This work corroborates and extends the ALICE findings on strangeness production in proton-proton collisions at 7 TeV.},

The parameters which describe the production of lighter hadron species also describe the hyperon spectra in high multiplicity p-Pb. The yield of hyperons relative to charged pions is studied and compared with results from pp and Pb-Pb collisions. A statistical model is employed, which describes the change in the ratios with volume using a canonical suppression mechanism, in which the small volume causes a species-dependent relative reduction of hadron production.

  abstract = {The production of \$\textbackslash pi\^\textbackslash pm\$, \$\{\textbackslash rm K\}\^\textbackslash pm\$, and \$(\textbackslash overline\{\textbackslash rm p\})\$p is measured in pp collisions at \$\textbackslash sqrt\{s\} = 13\$ TeV in different topological regions. Particle transverse momentum (\$p\_\{\textbackslash rm T\}\$) spectra are measured in the ``toward'', ``transverse'', and ``away'' angular regions defined with respect to the direction of the leading particle in the event. While the toward and away regions contain the fragmentation products of the near-side and away-side jets, respectively, the transverse region is dominated by particles from the Underlying Event (UE). The relative transverse activity classifier, \$R\_\{\textbackslash rm T\} = N\_\{\textbackslash rm T\} / \textbackslash langle N\_\{\textbackslash rm T\} \textbackslash rangle\$, is used to group events according to their UE activity, where \$N\_\{\textbackslash rm T\}\$ is the measured charged-particle multiplicity per event in the transverse region and \$\textbackslash langle N\_\{\textbackslash rm T\} \textbackslash rangle\$ is the mean value over all the analysed events. The first measurements of identified particle \$p\_\{\textbackslash rm T\}\$ spectra as a function of \$R\_\{\textbackslash rm T\}\$ in the three topological regions are reported. The yield of high transverse momentum particles relative to the \$R\_\{\textbackslash rm T\}\$-integrated measurement decreases with increasing \$R\_\{\textbackslash rm T\}\$ in both the toward and away regions, indicating that the softer UE dominates particle production as \$R\_\{\textbackslash rm T\}\$ increases and validating that \$R\_\{\textbackslash rm T\}\$ can be used to control the magnitude of the UE. Conversely, the spectral shapes in the transverse region harden significantly with increasing \$R\_\{\textbackslash rm T\}\$. This hardening follows a mass ordering, being more significant for heavier particles. The \$p\_\{\textbackslash rm T\}\$-differential particle ratios \$(\{\textbackslash rm p + \textbackslash overline\{p\}\})/(\textbackslash pi\^+ + \textbackslash pi\^-)\$ and \$(\{\textbackslash rm K\^+ + K\^-\})/(\textbackslash pi\^+ + \textbackslash pi\^-)\$ in the low UE limit \$(R\_\{\textbackslash rm T\} \textbackslash rightarrow 0)\$ approach expectations from Monte Carlo generators such as PYTHIA 8 and EPOS LHC, where the jet-fragmentation models have been tuned to reproduce \$\{\textbackslash rm e\^+ e\^-\}\$ results.},

The inclusive production of the same particle species and the corresponding ratios are also reported. The production of multi-strange hadrons, \$\textbackslash Xi\^\{\textbackslash pm\}\$ and \$\textbackslash Omega\^\{\textbackslash pm\}\$, and their associated particle ratios in jets and in the underlying event are measured for the first time. In both pp and p-Pb collisions, the baryon-to-meson and baryon-to-baryon yield ratios measured in jets differ from the inclusive particle production for low and intermediate hadron \$p\_\{\textbackslash rm T\}\$ (0.6\$-\$6 GeV/\$c\$). Ratios measured in the underlying event are in turn similar to those measured for inclusive particle production. In pp collisions, the particle production in jets is compared with PYTHIA 8 predictions with three colour-reconnection implementation modes. None of them fully reproduces the data in the measured hadron \$p\_T\$ region. The maximum deviation is observed for \$\textbackslash Xi\^\{\textbackslash pm\}\$ and \$\textbackslash Omega\^\{\textbackslash pm\}\$, which reaches a factor of about six. In p-Pb collisions, there is no significant event-multiplicity dependence for particle production in jets, in contrast to what is observed in the underlying event. The presented measurements provide novel constraints on hadronisation and its Monte Carlo description. In particular, they demonstrate that the fragmentation of jets alone is insufficient to describe the strange and multi-strange particle production in hadronic collisions at LHC energies.},

The mean sphericity as a function of the charged particle multiplicity at mid-rapidity (\$N\_\{\textbackslash rm ch\}\$) is reported for events with different \$p\_\{\textbackslash rm T\}\$ scales ("soft" and "hard") defined by the transverse momentum of the leading particle. In addition, the mean charged particle transverse momentum versus multiplicity is presented for the different event classes, and the sphericity distributions in bins of multiplicity are presented. The data are compared with calculations of standard Monte Carlo event generators. The transverse sphericity is found to grow with multiplicity at all collision energies, with a steeper rise at low \$N\_\{\textbackslash rm ch\}\$, whereas the event generators show the opposite tendency. The combined study of the sphericity and the mean \$p\_\{\textbackslash rm T\}\$ with multiplicity indicates that most of the tested event generators produce events with higher multiplicity by generating more back-to-back jets resulting in decreased sphericity (and isotropy). The PYTHIA6 generator with tune PERUGIA-2011 exhibits a noticeable improvement in describing the data, compared to the other tested generators.},

  abstract = {This article reports measurements characterizing the Unde{$\surd$}rlying Event (UE) associated with hard scatterings at midrapidity (|{$\eta$}| {$<$} 0.8) in pp collisions at s = 13 TeV. The hard scatterings are identified by the leading particle, the charged particle with the highest transverse momentum (plTeading) in the event. Charged-particle number-densities and summed transverse-momentum densities are measured in different azimuthal regions defined with respect to the leading particle direction: Toward, Transverse, and Away. The Toward and Away regions contain the fragmentation products of the hard scatterings in addition to the UE contribution, whereas particles in the Transverse region are expected to originate predominantly from the UE. The study is performed as a function of plTeading with three different pT thresholds for the associated particles, ptTrack {$>$} 0.15, 0.5, and 1.0 GeV/c. The charged-particle density in the Transverse region rises steeply for low values of plTeadingand reaches a plateau. The results confirm{$\surd$}the trend that the charged-particle density in the Transverse region shows a stronger increase with s than the inclusive charged-particle density at midrapidity. The UE activity is increased by approximately 20\% when going from 7 TeV to 13 TeV pp collisions. The plateau in the Transverse region (5 {$<$} plTeading {$<$} 40 GeV/c) is further characterized by the probability distribution of its charged-particle multiplicity normalized to its average value (relative transverse activity, RT) and the mean transverse momentum as a function of RT. Experimental results are compared to model calculations using PYTHIA 8 and EPOS LHC. The overall agreement between models and data is within 30\%. These measurements provide new insights on the interplay between hard scatterings and the associated UE in pp collisions.},

  abstract = {We introduce the concepts of participant triangularity and triangular flow in heavy-ion collisions, analogous to the definitions of participant eccentricity and elliptic flow. The participant triangularity characterizes the triangular anisotropy of the initial nuclear overlap geometry and arises from event-by-event fluctuations in the participant-nucleon collision points. In studies using a multi-phase transport model (AMPT), a triangular flow signal is observed that is proportional to the participant triangularity and corresponds to a large third Fourier coefficient in two-particle azimuthal correlation functions. Using two-particle azimuthal correlations at large pseudorapidity separations measured by the PHOBOS and STAR experiments, we show that this Fourier component is also present in data. Ratios of the second and third Fourier coefficients in data exhibit similar trends as a function of centrality and transverse momentum as in AMPT calculations. These findings suggest a significant contribution of triangular flow to the ridge and broad away-side features observed in data. Triangular flow provides a new handle on the initial collision geometry and collective expansion dynamics in heavy-ion collisions.},

Extending previous studies by inclusion of very high-mass resonances (m{$>$}2~GeV), and the up-to-now neglected scalar {$\sigma$} meson leads to an improved description of the data. In particular, the hitherto poorly reproduced energy dependence of the K+/{$\pi$}+ ratio at SPS energies (``the horn'') is now well described through the connection to the hadronic mass spectrum and, implicitly, Hagedorn's limiting temperature.

  abstract = {Multiplicity distributions of charged particles produced in non single-diffractive collisions between protons and antiprotons at centre of mass energies of 200 and 900 GeV are presented. The data were recorded in the UA5 streamer chambers at the CERN Collider, which was operated in a pulsed mode between the two energies. A new method to correct for acceptance limitations and inefficiencies based on the principle of maximum entropy has been used. Multiplicity distributions in full phase space and in intervals of pseudorapidity are presented in tabular form. The violation of KNO scaling in full phase space found by the UA5 group at an energy of 546 GeV is confirmed also at 200 and 900 GeV. The shape of the 900 GeV distribution in full phase space is narrower in the peak region than at 200 GeV but exhibits a pronounced high multiplicity tail. The negative binomial distribution fits data at 200 GeV in all pseudorapidity intervals and in small intervals at 900 GeV. In large intervals at 900 GeV, however, the negative binomial distribution. Fits to the partially coherent laser distribution are also presented as well as comparisons with predictions of the Dual Parton, the Fritiof and the Pythia models.},

The distributions were constructed using charged particles with absolute pseudorapidity less than 2.5 and with transverse momentum greater than 500 MeV, in events with at least one such charged particle with transverse momentum above 1 GeV. These distributions characterise the angular distribution of energy and particle flows with respect to the charged particle with highest transverse momentum, as a function of both that momentum and of charged-particle multiplicity. The results have been corrected for detector effects and are compared to the predictions of various Monte Carlo event generators, experimentally establishing the level of underlying-event activity at LHC Run 2 energies and providing inputs for the development of event generator modelling.

This is the first time that such a matching has been carried out for hadronic final-state observables at hadron colliders. We compare our results to Monte Carlo predictions, with and without matching to multi-parton tree-level fixed-order calculations. These studies suggest that hadron-collider event shapes have significant scope for constraining both perturbative and non-perturbative aspects of hadron-collider QCD. The differences between various calculational methods also highlight the limits of relying on simultaneous variations of renormalisation and factorisation scale in making reliable estimates of uncertainties in QCD predictions. We also discuss the sensitivity of event shapes to the topology of multi-jet events, which are expected to appear in many New Physics scenarios.},

These data were obtained using the CLEO detector at the Cornell Electron Storage Ring (CESR) and provide information on the production of {$\pi$}, K, {$\rho$}, K*, {$\varphi$}, p, {$\Lambda$}, and {$\Xi$} in quark and gluon jets. The average multiplicity of hadrons per event for upsilon decays (compared with continuum annihilations) is 11.4 (10.5) pions, 2.4 (2.2) kaons, 0.6 (0.5) {$\rho$}0, 1.2 (0.8) K*, 0.6 (0.4) protons and antiprotons, 0.15 (0.08) {$\varphi$}, 0.19 (0.07) {$\Lambda$} and {$\Lambda$}\textasciimacron, and 0.016 (0.005) {$\Xi-$} and {$\Xi$}\textasciimacron{} +. We have also seen evidence for {$\eta$} and f0 production. The most significant differences between upsilon and continuum final states are (1) the inclusive energy spectra fall off more rapidly with increasing particle energy in upsilon decays, (2) the production of heavier particles, especially baryons, is not as strongly suppressed in upsilon decays, and (3) baryon and antibaryon are more likely to be correlated at long range in upsilon decay than in continuum events.},

The study is performed as a function of the relative transverse activity classifier, R T, which is the relative charged-particle multiplicity in the transverse region ({$\pi$}/3 {$<$} |{$\phi$} trig. - {$\phi$} assoc.| {$<$} 2{$\pi$}/3) of the di-hadron correlations, and it is sensitive to the multi-parton interactions. The evolution of the yield of associated particles on both the towards and the away regions ( GeV/c) as a function of R T is investigated. We propose a strategy which allows for the modelling and subtraction of the underlying event contribution from the towards and the away regions in challenging environments like those characterised by large R T. We found that the signal in the away region becomes broader with increasing R T, while its corresponding yield is independent of R T. Contrarily, the yield increases with R T in the towards region. This effect is reminiscent of that seen in heavy-ion collisions, where an enhancement of the yield in the towards region for 0\%\textendash 5\% central Pb\textendash Pb collisions at TeV was reported. A discussion on the origin of these effects in PYTHIA, as well as their implications for the interpretation of recent LHC results for pp collisions, is presented.},

  abstract = {We present a new model for building up complete exclusive hadronic final states in high energy nucleus collisions. It is a direct extrapolation of high energy pp collisions (as described by PYTHIA), and thus bridges a large part of the existing gap between heavy ion and high energy physics phenomenology. The model is inspired by the old Fritiof model and the notion of wounded nucleons. Two essential features are the treatment of multi-parton interactions and diffractive excitation in each NN sub-collision. Diffractive excitation is related to fluctuations in the nucleon partonic sub-structure, and fluctuations in both projectile and target are here included for the first time. The model is able to give a good description of general final-state properties such as multiplicity and transverse momentum distributions, both in pA and AA collisions. The model can therefore serve as a baseline for understanding the non-collective background to observables sensitive to collective behaviour. As PYTHIA does not include a mechanism to reproduce the collective effects seen in pp collisions, such effects are also not reproduced by the present version of Angantyr. Effects of high string density, shown to be able to reproduce e.g. higher strangeness ratios and the ridge in pp, will be added in future studies},

  abstract = {This manual describes the PYTHIA 8.3 event generator, the most recent version of an evolving physics tool used to answer fundamental questions in particle physics. The program is most often used to generate high-energy-physics collision "events", i.e. sets of particles produced in association with the collision of two incoming high-energy particles, but has several uses beyond that. The guiding philosophy is to produce and reproduce properties of experimentally obtained collisions as accurately as possible. The program includes a wide ranges of reactions within and beyond the Standard Model, and extending to heavy ion physics. Emphasis is put on phenomena where strong interactions play a major role. The manual contains both pedagogical and practical components. All included physics models are described in enough detail to allow the user to obtain a cursory overview of used assumptions and approximations, enabling an informed evaluation of the program output. A number of the most central algorithms are described in enough detail that the main results of the program can be reproduced independently, allowing further development of existing models or the addition of new ones. Finally, a chapter dedicated fully to the user is included towards the end, providing pedagogical examples of standard use cases, and a detailed description of a number of external interfaces. The program code, the online manual, and the latest version of this print manual can be found on the PYTHIA web page: https://www.pythia.org/},

Specifically we investigate ratios of identified hadron yields as a function of the final-state activity, as measured by the charged multiplicity. Since both models have a nontrivial dependence on the final-state activity, the above observables serve as excellent probes to test the effect of these models. Both models show a clear baryon enhancement with increasing multiplicity, while only the DIPSY rope model leads to a strangeness enhancement. Flow-like patterns, previously found to be connected to colour reconnection models, are investigated for the new models. Only PYTHIA shows a \$p\_\textbackslash perp\$-dependent enhancement of the \$\textbackslash Lambda/K\$ ratio as the final-state activity increases, with the enhancement being largest in the mid-\$p\_\textbackslash perp\$ region.},

  abstract = {In models for hadron collisions based on string hadronization, the strings are usually treated as independent, allowing no interaction between the confined colour fields. In studies of nucleus collisions it has been suggested that strings close in space can fuse to form "colour ropes". Such ropes are expected to give more strange particles and baryons, which also has been suggested as a signal for plasma formation. Overlapping strings can also be expected in pp collisions, where usually no phase transition is expected. In particular at the high LHC energies the expected density of strings is quite high. To investigate possible effects of rope formation, we present a model in which strings are allowed to combine into higher multiplets, giving rise to increased production of baryons and strangeness, or recombine into singlet structures and vanish. Also a crude model for strings recombining into junction structures is considered, again giving rise to increased baryon production. The models are implemented in the DIPSY MC event generator, using PYTHIA 8 for hadronization, and comparison to pp minimum bias data, reveals improvement in the description of identified particle spectra.},

Measurements of the inclusive jet cross-sections and fragmentation properties have confirmed that QCD based calculations give a good description of the hard scattering processes. However, as our analysis of jets has improved it has become clear that there is significant contribution to these measurements from processes other than those directly related to the initial hard scattering - the so-called underlying event. Several processes contribute to the underlying event, namely the beam-beam remnants, initial and final state radiation and multiple parton interactions. The structure of the jet and the underlying event are strikingly different in both their particle compositions and momentum distributions. Only by understanding both components can one fully describe a p-p collision. I will discuss preliminary results from studies of the underlying event in p-p collisions at sqrt(s) = 200 GeV at RHIC, and compare to PYTHIA predictions, as well as earlier results from the Tevatron at 1.8-1.96 TeV.},

  abstract = {The growth and development of ``charged particle jets'' produced in proton-antiproton collisions at 1.8TeV are studied over a transverse momentum range from 0.5 GeV/c to 50 GeV/c. A variety of leading (highest transverse momentum) charged jet observables are compared with the QCD Monte Carlo models HERWIG, ISAJET, and PYTHIA. The models describe fairly well the multiplicity distribution of charged particles within the leading charged jet, the size of the leading charged jet, the radial distribution of charged particles and transverse momentum around the leading charged jet direction, and the momentum distribution of charged particles within the leading charged jet. The direction of the leading ``charged particle jet'' in each event is used to define three regions of {$\eta-\varphi$} space. The ``toward'' region contains the leading ``charged particle jet,'' while the ``away'' region, on the average, contains the away-side jet. The ``transverse'' region is perpendicular to the plane of the hard 2-to-2 scattering and is very sensitive to the ``underlying event'' component of the QCD Monte Carlo models. HERWIG, ISAJET, and PYTHIA with their default parameters do not describe correctly all the properties of the ``transverse'' region.},

At all fixed centralities, the nuclear modification factors show no significant suppressions, contrast to the strong suppressions observed for central Au+Au collisions. Our results are consistent with the PHENIX preliminary Data in minimum bias and central d+Au collisions. The LHC experimental Data also support our predictions for both single inclusive hadron and inclusive jets productions in central p+Pb collisions.

For high-multiplicity pp events, a mass ordering is observed for the v[2] values of charged hadrons (mostly pions), K0 short, and Lambda/anti-Lambda, with lighter particle species exhibiting a stronger azimuthal anisotropy signal below pt of about 2 GeV/c. For 13 TeV data, the v[2] signals are also extracted from four- and six-particle correlations for the first time in pp collisions, with comparable magnitude to those from two-particle correlations. These observations are similar to those seen in pPb and PbPb collisions, and support the interpretation of a collective origin for the observed long-range correlations in high-multiplicity pp collisions.},

  abstract = {We review the present knowledge for \$\textbackslash alpha\_s\$, the fundamental coupling underlying the interactions of quarks and gluons in QCD. The dependence of \$\textbackslash alpha\_s(Q\^2)\$ on momentum transfer \$Q\$ encodes the underlying dynamics of hadron physics -from color confinement in the infrared domain to asymptotic freedom at short distances. We review constraints on \$\textbackslash alpha\_s(Q\^2)\$ at high \$Q\^2\$, as predicted by perturbative QCD, and its analytic behavior at small \$Q\^2\$, based on models of nonperturbative dynamics. In the introductory part of this review, we explain the phenomenological meaning of \$\textbackslash alpha\_s\$, the reason for its running, and the challenges facing a complete understanding of its analytic behavior in the infrared domain. In the second, more technical, part of the review, we discuss the behavior of \$\textbackslash alpha\_s(Q\^2)\$ in the high \$Q\^2\$ domain of QCD. We review how \$\textbackslash alpha\_s\$ is defined, including its renormalization scheme dependence, the definition of its renormalization scale, the utility of effective charges, as well as Commensurate Scale Relations which connect the various definitions of \$\textbackslash alpha\_s\$ without renormalization-scale ambiguity. We also report recent measurements and theoretical analyses which have led to precise QCD predictions at high energy. In the last part of the review, we discuss the challenge of understanding the analytic behavior \$\textbackslash alpha\_s(Q\^2)\$ in the infrared domain. We also review important methods for computing \$\textbackslash alpha\_s\$, including lattice QCD, the Schwinger-Dyson equations, the Gribov-Zwanziger analysis and light-front holographic QCD. After describing these approaches and enumerating their conflicting predictions, we discuss the origin of these discrepancies and how to remedy them. Our aim is not only to review the advances in this difficult area, but also to suggest what could be an optimal definition of \$\textbackslash alpha\_s\$ in order to bring better unity to the subject.},

The most important aspect of our approach is a self-consistent treatment, using the same formalism for calculating cross sections and particle production, based on an effective, QCD-inspired field theory, where many of the inconsistencies of presently used models will be avoided. In addition, we provide a unified treatment of soft and hard scattering, such that there is no fundamental cutoff parameter any more defining an artificial border between soft and hard scattering. Our approach cures some of the main deficiencies of two of the standard procedures currently used: the Gribov-Regge theory and the eikonalized parton model. There, cross section calculations and particle production cannot be treated in a consistent way using a common formalism. In particular, energy conservation is taken care of in case of particle production, but not concerning cross section calculations. In addition, hard contributions depend crucially on some cutoff, being divergent for the cutoff being zero. Finally, in case of several elementary scatterings, they are not treated on the same level: the first collision is always treated differently than the subsequent ones. All these problems are solved in our new approach.},

The combined data set considered in this report corresponds to a total luminosity of about 3~fb-1 collected by the four LEP experiments ALEPH, DELPHI, L3 and OPAL, at centre-of-mass energies ranging from 130~GeV to 209~GeV. Combining the published results of the four LEP experiments, the measurements include total and differential cross-sections in photon-pair, fermion-pair and four-fermion production, the latter resulting from both double-resonant WW and ZZ production as well as singly resonant production. Total and differential cross-sections are measured precisely, providing a stringent test of the Standard Model at centre-of-mass energies never explored before in electron\textendash positron collisions. Final-state interaction effects in four-fermion production, such as those arising from colour reconnection and Bose\textendash Einstein correlations between the two W decay systems arising in WW production, are searched for and upper limits on the strength of possible effects are obtained. The data are used to determine fundamental properties of the W boson and the electroweak theory.

At higher energies, a similar explanation would violate the Heisenberg principle, since the calculations based on the uncertainty principle lead to a charmonium formation time expected to be larger than the nuclear radius, which results in identical nuclear break-up probability for the {$\psi$}(2S) and J/{$\psi$}. On the contrary, this behavior is naturally explained by the interactions of the quarkonium states with a comoving medium.

Some first results are presented, for toy systems but in particular for LHC events. The density of hadron production is quantified under different conditions. The (not unexpected) conclusion is that this density can become quite high, and thereby motivate the observed collective behaviour in high-multiplicity pp collisions.

The reasons for doing this are recounted, including a review of renormalization-group techniques and their application to scaling phenomena. The renormalization-group equations are derived for Yang-Mills theories. The parameters that enter into the equations are calculated to lowest order and it is shown that these theories are asymptotically free. More specifically the effective coupling constant, which determines the ultraviolet behavior of the theory, vanishes for large spacelike momenta. Fermions are incorporated and the construction of realistic models is discussed. We propose that the strong interactions be mediated by a "color" gauge group which commutes with SU(3) \texttimes{} SU(3). The problem of symmetry breaking is discussed. It appears likely that this would have a dynamical origin. It is suggested that the gauge symmetry might not be broken and that the severe infrared singularities prevent the occurrence of noncolor singlet physical states. The deep-inelastic structure functions, as well as the electron-positron total annihilation cross section are analyzed. Scaling obtains up to calculable logarithmic corrections, and the naive light-cone or parton-model results follow. The problems of incorporating scalar mesons and breaking the symmetry by the Higgs mechanism are explained in detail.},

The starting point is our recent study in vacuum, where the sum rules have been quantitatively satisfied using phenomenological vector and axial-vector spectral functions which describe hadronic {$\tau$}-decay data. In the medium, the temperature dependence of condensates and chiral order parameters is taken from thermal lattice QCD where available, and otherwise is estimated from a hadron resonance gas. Since little is known about the in-medium axial-vector spectral function, we model it with a Breit\textendash Wigner ansatz allowing for smooth temperature variations of its width and mass parameters. Our study thus amounts to testing the compatibility of the {$\rho$}-broadening found in dilepton experiments with (the approach toward) chiral restoration, and thereby searching for viable in-medium axial-vector spectral functions.},

We argue that sufficiently large magnetic fields are created in heavy ion collisions so that the Chiral Magnetic Effect causes preferential emission of charged particles along the direction of angular momentum. Since separation of charge is CP-odd, any observation of the Chiral Magnetic Effect could provide a clear demonstration of the topological nature of the QCD vacuum.

In nucleus-nucleus collisions this effect has to be reliably calculated as baseline for a signal of new physics in high-\$p\_T\$ hadron production. The only possibility to test models is to compare with available data for \$pA\$ collisions, however, all existing models for the Cronin effect rely on a fit to the data to be explained. We develop a phenomenological description based on the light-cone QCD-dipole approach which allows to explain available data without fitting to them and to provide predictions for \$pA\$ collisions at RHIC and LHC. We point out that the mechanism causing Cronin effect drastically changes between the energies of fixed target experiments and RHIC-LHC.

This model is used to calculate "geometric" quantities, which are typically expressed as impact parameter (b), number of participating nucleons (N\_part) and number of binary nucleon-nucleon collisions (N\_coll). A brief history of the original Glauber model is presented, with emphasis on its development into the purely classical, geometric picture that is used for present-day data analyses. Distinctions are made between the "optical limit" and Monte Carlo approaches, which are often used interchangably but have some essential differences in particular contexts. The methods used by the four RHIC experiments are compared and contrasted, although the end results are reassuringly similar for the various geometric observables. Finally, several important RHIC measurements are highlighted that rely on geometric quantities, estimated from Glauber calculations, to draw insight from experimental observables. The status and future of Glauber modeling in the next generation of heavy ion physics studies is briefly discussed.},

  abstract = {Finite-density lattice QCD aims for the first-principle study of QCD at finite density, which describes the system consisting of many quarks. The main targets are systems such as quark\textendash gluon plasma, nuclei, and neutron stars. Explaining macroscopic physics from the microscopic theory is a natural path in the development of physics. To understand the strong interaction completely, we have to solve finite-density QCD. Each of the systems mentioned above has open problems which cannot easily be accessed by experiment or observation, so it is important to make progress in finite-density lattice QCD. In this article, we summarize the past development and current status of the field of finite-density lattice QCD. The difficulty in the study of theories with the sign problem is that the numerical methods which are correct in principle do not necessarily work in practice and it is hard to know when it fails. We will introduce various approaches in this article, but all of them have pitfalls, which lead to unphysical results unless we study carefully. We will explain what kinds of studies were done in the past, to what extent they succeeded, and what kinds of obstacles they encountered, and why the approaches are correct in principle can lead to wrong answers. In this way, we would like to provide lessons from the past for ambitious researchers who plan to work on the finite-density lattice QCD.},

  abstract = {Through ultrarelativistic particle collisions at the LHC, it is possible to deconfine quarks and gluons. This deconfinement gives rise to a strongly interacting medium, referred to as the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). One of the earliest proposed and observed signatures of the QGP was the enhanced production of strange hadrons since the medium can thermally produce strange quarks. However, recent studies in small systems, such as proton\textendash proton (pp) and proton-lead (pPb) collisions, have exhibited similar features. These findings arequite puzzling, as the formation of a QGP in these small collision systems challenges current theoretical frameworks.In this Thesis, I present two different studies on the production of {$\varphi$} mesons, in relation to {$\Xi$} baryons, in pp collisions at {$\surd$}s = 13 TeV, measured with the ALICE apparatus. Both of these studies aim to investigate the origin of strange hadron enhancement in high-multiplicity pp collisions. First, I report measurements of {$\varphi$} production as a function of the event-shape observable Unweighted Transverse Spherocity, SOpT=1. With SOpT=1 , it is possible to categorize events by their azimuthal topology. I utilize SOpT=1 to contrast particle production in collisionsdominated by many soft initial interactions, with collisions dominated by a single hard scattering. I find that strangeness enhancement is prominent in soft, isotropic topologies, whereas events with di-jet topologies showcase a clear suppression of strange particles.The second study presents the production of {$\varphi$} mesons and {$\Xi$} hadrons as a function of the Relative Transverse Activity RT . With RT , one can control the size of the Underlying Event (UE). By varying RT, it is therefore possible to study the interplay between particle production from hard fragmentation in jets, and soft particles produced by the UE. The reported results suggest that strange particle production is mainly a feature of the UE. When put together, the two studies suggest that high-multiplicity pp collisions are in general dominated by soft physics, which is also responsible for the strangeness enhancement, whilehigh-multiplicity events dominated by hard physics are rare outliers.},

  abstract = {A study of the charged-particle density (number density) in the transverse region of the di-hadron correlations exploiting the existing pp and p\$\textbackslash bar\{\textbackslash rm p\}\$ data from RHIC to LHC energies is reported. This region has contributions from the Underlying Event (UE) as well as from Initial- and Final-State Radiation (ISR-FSR). Based on the data, a two-component model is built. This has the functional form \$\textbackslash propto s\^\{\textbackslash alpha\}+\textbackslash beta\textbackslash log(s)\$, where the logarithmic ((\$\textbackslash beta = 0.140 \textbackslash pm 0.007\$)) and the power-law (\$\textbackslash alpha = 0.270 \textbackslash pm 0.005\$) terms describe the components more sensitive to the ISR-FSR and UE contributions, respectively. The model describes the data from RHIC to LHC energies, the extrapolation to higher energies indicates that at around \$\textbackslash sqrt\{s\} \textbackslash approx 100\$\textbackslash,TeV the number density associated to UE will match that from ISR-FSR. Although this behaviour is not predicted by PYTHIA\textasciitilde 8.244, the power-law behaviour of the UE contribution is consistent with the energy dependence of the parameter that regulates Multiparton Interactions. Using simulations, KNO-like scaling properties of the multiplicity distributions in the regions sensitive to either UE or ISR-FSR are also discussed. The results presented here can be helpful to constrain QCD-inspired Monte Carlo models at the Future Circular Collider energies, as well as to characterize the UE-based event classifiers which are currently used at the LHC.},

  abstract = {Multiparton interactions (MPI) in pp collisions have attracted the attention of the heavy-ion community since they can help to elucidate the origin of collectivelike effects discovered in small collision systems at the LHC. In this work, we report that in pythia8.244, the charged-particle production in events with a large number of MPI (Nmpi) normalized to that obtained in minimum-bias pp collisions shows interesting features. After the normalization to the corresponding {$\langle$}Nmpi{$\rangle$}, the ratios as a function of pT exhibit a bump at pT{$\approx$}3 GeV/c; and for higher pT ({$>$}8 GeV/c), the ratios are independent of Nmpi. While the size of the bump increases with increasing Nmpi, the behavior at high pT is expected from the ``binary scaling'' (parton-parton interactions), which holds given the absence of any parton-energy loss mechanism in pythia. The bump at intermediate pT is reminiscent of the Cronin effect observed for the nuclear modification factor in p-Pb collisions. In order to unveil these effects in data, we propose a strategy to construct an event classifier sensitive to MPI using machine learning-based regression. The study is conducted using TMVA, and the regression is performed with boosted decision trees (BDT). Event properties like forward charged-particle multiplicity, transverse spherocity and the average transverse momentum ({$\langle$}pT{$\rangle$}) are used for training. The kinematic cuts are defined in accordance with the ALICE detector capabilities. For the validation of the method and to find possible model dependence, we also compare the results from pythia8.244 with herwig7.1. In addition, we also report that if we apply the trained BDT on existing (INEL{$>$}0) pp data, i.e., events with at least one primary charged-particle within |{$\eta$}|{$<$}1, the average number of MPI in pp collisions at {$\surd$}s=5.02 and 13 TeV are 3.76{$\pm$}1.01 and 4.65{$\pm$}1.01, respectively.},

Since the last public release in 2009, the LHC experiments have provided a number of very interesting data sets comprising minimum bias p-p, p-Pb and Pb-Pb interactions. We describe the changes required to the model to reproduce in detail the new data available from LHC and the consequences in the interpretation of these data. In particular we discuss the effect of the collective hadronization in p-p scattering. A different parametrization of flow has been introduced in the case of a small volume with high density of thermalized matter (core) reached in p-p compared to large volume produced in heavy ion collisions. Both parametrizations depend only on the geometry and the amount of secondary particles entering in the core and not on the beam mass or energy. The transition between the two flow regimes can be tested with p-Pb data. EPOS LHC is able to reproduce all minimum bias},

We first show how the predictions of hadronic many-body theory for a melting \$\textbackslash rho\$ meson, coupled with QGP emission utilizing a modern lattice-QCD based equation of state, yield a quantitative description of dilepton spectra in heavy-ion collisions at the SPS and the RHIC beam energy scan program. We utilize these results to systematically extract the excess yields and their invariant-mass spectral slopes to predict the excitation function of fireball lifetimes and (early) temperatures, respectively. We thereby demonstrate that future measurements of these quantities can yield unprecedented information on basic fireball properties. Specifically, our predictions quantify the relation between the measured and maximal fireball temperatures, and the proportionality of excess yields and total lifetime. This information can serve as a "caloric" curve to search for a first-order QCD phase transition, and to detect non-monotonous lifetime variations possibly related to critical phenomena.},

  abstract = {The ultimate aim of high energy heavy ion collisions is to study quark deconfinement and the quark-gluon plasma predicted by quantum chromodynamics. This requires the identification of observables calculable in QCD and measurable in heavy ion collisions. I concentrate on three such phenomena, related to specific features of strongly interacting matter. The observed pattern of hadrosynthesis corresponds to that of an ideal resonance gas in equilibrium at the pseudo-critical temperature determined in QCD. The critical behavior of QCD is encoded in the fluctuation patterns of conserved quantum numbers, which are presently being measured. The temperature of the quark-gluon plasma can be determined by the dissociation patterns of the different quarkonium states, now under study at the LHC for both charmonia and bottomonia.},

  abstract = {This thesis is concerned with the analysis of universal properties of several physical observables in strongly coupled plasmas as they are studied in heavy-ion collisions \textendash{} for example at the LHC. The focus lies on the energy loss of a uniformly moving and of a rotating quark, the running coupling as defined via the free energy of static quark-antiquark (QQbar)-pairs and the maximum distance (screening distance) of a (QQbar)-pair in the hot plasma. All of them have been computed using the AdS/CFT correspondence. In order to discover a universal behaviour in the observables, computations have been worked out in the free gravity theory in AdS5 space-time which is dual to N=4 supersymmetric Yang\textendash Mills theory as well as in three deformed, non-conformal metric models. Two of these are solutions to Einstein equations derived from a supergravity action. It has been shown that the energy loss of uniformly moving and of rotating quarks is very robust in all deformed models compared to the conformal results. In the case of the running coupling the introduction of deformations leads to a universal increase for larger (QQbar)-distances. This is qualitatively consistent with lattice QCD simulations. For the screening distance a proof has been presented for the conjecture that the conformal N=4T value for the screening distance is a lower bound for small perturbations around the conformal solution. Such a behaviour had been observed before in numerical studies in all of the above-mentioned deformed metric models.},

The laureates are, respectively, professors of physics at the University of California in Santa Barbara, Caltech, and MIT. The discovery was made in 1973 by Gross and Wilczek 1  at Princeton University and, independently, by Politzer 2  at Harvard University. At the time, Wilczek was Gross's graduate student and Politzer was a graduate student of Sidney Coleman.Asymptotic freedom refers to the vanishing of the strong nuclear force between quarks as the distance between them goes to zero. The surprising discovery by Gross, Wilczek, and Politzer that a certain class of quantum field theories has this property led quite quickly to quantum chromodynamics  (QCD), the now standard theory of the strong interactions (see the article by Wilczek in  Physics Today,   Physics Today\hphantom{,}0031-9228\hphantom{,}53\hphantom{,}8\hphantom{,}2000\hphantom{,}22\hphantom{,}10.1063/1.1310117\hphantom{,}August 2000, page 22 ). The dauntingly complex laboratory manifestations of the strong interactions had prompted Freeman Dyson in the late 1950s to predict pessimistically that it might be 100 years before a proper theory emerged.},

We observe a clear suppression of the correlated yields of back-to-back {$\pi$}0 pairs in p+Al and p+Au collisions compared to the p+p data. The observed suppression of back-to-back pairs as a function of transverse momentum suggests nonlinear gluon dynamics arising at high parton densities. The larger suppression found in p+Au relative to p+Al collisions exhibits a dependence of the saturation scale Q2s on the mass number A. A linear scaling of the suppression with A1/3 is observed with a slope of -0.09{$\pm$}0.01.},

  abstract = {The chiral magnetic effect (CME) is predicted to occur as a consequence of a local violation of \$\textbackslash cal P\$ and \$\textbackslash cal CP\$ symmetries of the strong interaction amidst a strong electro-magnetic field generated in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Experimental manifestation of the CME involves a separation of positively and negatively charged hadrons along the direction of the magnetic field. Previous measurements of the CME-sensitive charge-separation observables remain inconclusive because of large background contributions. In order to better control the influence of signal and backgrounds, the STAR Collaboration performed a blind analysis of a large data sample of approximately 3.8 billion isobar collisions of \$\^\{96\}\_\{44\}\$Ru+\$\^\{96\}\_\{44\}\$Ru and \$\^\{96\}\_\{40\}\$Zr+\$\^\{96\}\_\{40\}\$Zr at \$\textbackslash sqrt\{s\_\{\textbackslash rm NN\}\}=200\$ GeV. Prior to the blind analysis, the CME signatures are predefined as a significant excess of the CME-sensitive observables in Ru+Ru collisions over those in Zr+Zr collisions, owing to a larger magnetic field in the former. A precision down to 0.4\% is achieved, as anticipated, in the relative magnitudes of the pertinent observables between the two isobar systems. Observed differences in the multiplicity and flow harmonics at the matching centrality indicate that the magnitude of the CME background is different between the two species. No CME signature that satisfies the predefined criteria has been observed in isobar collisions in this blind analysis.},

  abstract = {The standard model of particle physics1\textendash 4 describes the known fundamental particles and forces that make up our Universe, with the exception of gravity. One of the central features of the standard model is a field that permeates all of space and interacts with fundamental particles5\textendash 9. The quantum excitation of this field, known as the Higgs field, manifests itself as the Higgs boson, the only fundamental particle with no spin. In 2012, a particle with properties consistent with the Higgs boson of the standard model~was observed by the ATLAS and CMS experiments at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN10,11. Since then, more than 30\,times as many Higgs bosons have been recorded by the ATLAS experiment, enabling much more precise measurements and new tests of the theory. Here, on the basis of this larger dataset, we combine an unprecedented number of production and decay processes of the Higgs boson to scrutinize its interactions with elementary particles. Interactions with gluons, photons, and W and Z bosons\textemdash the carriers of the strong, electromagnetic and weak forces\textemdash are studied in detail. Interactions with three third-generation matter particles (bottom (b) and top (t) quarks, and~tau leptons ({$\tau$})) are well measured and indications of interactions with a second-generation particle (muons, {$\mu$}) are emerging. These tests reveal that the Higgs boson discovered ten years ago is remarkably consistent with the predictions of the theory and provide stringent constraints on many models of new phenomena beyond the standard model.},

The expected significance for a standard model Higgs boson of that mass is 5.8 standard deviations. The excess is most significant in the two decay modes with the best mass resolution, gamma gamma and ZZ; a fit to these signals gives a mass of 125.3 +/- 0.4 (stat.) +/- 0.5 (syst.) GeV.

  abstract = {High-energy heavy-ion collisions allow the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) production and study, a state of high-density QCD matter in which quarks and gluons are no longer confined inside hadrons for a very short time. Different observables reveal an enhanced production of strange hadrons, signatures of collective effects and opacity to jets due to the QGP formation. However, collective effects and strangeness enhancement are also observed in pp and p-Pb collisions (small systems) with high charged-particle multiplicity. These observations in small systems are very puzzling since the QGP is not expected to be formed since the small systems are considered too dilute and too short-lived.In this thesis, I present a study on the production of {$\pi$}, K and p in pp collisions at {$\surd$}s = 13 TeV using data recorded by the ALICE experiment. To investigate the origins of collective effects and strangeness enhancement, I measure the particle production as a function of the Relative Transverse Activity (RT) and the Transverse Spherocity (S0). In the RT analysis, particle production is measured in different topological regions (toward, away, and transverse) with respect to the leading charged track per event. The toward and away regions mainly contain the fragmentation products of the jet, while the Underlying Event dominates the transverse. The transverse momentum spectra and K/{$\pi$} and p/{$\pi$} ratios are measured as a function of RT = NT/{$\langle$}NT{$\rangle$}, where NT is the charged-particle multiplicity in the transverse region. It is observed that the K/{$\pi$} and p/{$\pi$} ratios increase with increasing RT in the toward region, while little RT dependence is observed in the transverse. Models tuned to e+e- results describe the low-RT particle ratios qualitatively.The transverse spherocity is an event shape observable that can disentangle jet-like from isotropic topologies. I studied particle production in high-multiplicity events as a function of spherocity. I contrast the results obtained using a forward and a mid-pseudorapidity multiplicity estimator. The results show that the mid-pseudorapidity estimator combined with the spherocity selection allows selecting events with more significant variations in the average transverse momentum ({$\langle$}pT{$\rangle$}) than the forward estimator. I present the pT spectra and particle ratios as a function of S0. Finally, all the data results are contrasted with microscopic models.},

  abstract = {Background: Proton-nucleus collisions have been used as a intermediate baseline for the determination of cold medium effects. They lie between proton-proton collisions in vacuum and nucleus-nucleus collisions which are expected to be dominated by hot matter effects. Modifications of the quark densities in nuclei relative to those of the proton are well established although those of the gluons in the nucleus are not well understood. We focus on the effect of these on quarkonium production in proton-lead collisions at the LHC at a center of mass energy of 5.02 TeV.},

Assuming an effective energy loss \$dE/dx\$ for the high \$E\_T\$ partons, effective jet fragmentation functions are constructed in which leading hadrons will be suppressed. Using such effective fragmentation functions, high \$p\_T\$ hadron spectra and particle suppression factors relative to \$pp\$ collisions are estimated in central high-energy nuclear collisions with a given range of the assumed \$dE/dx\$.

We analyse these data using EPOS3, an event generator based on a 3D+1 viscous hydrodynamical evolution starting from flux tube initial conditions, which are generated in the Gribov-Regge multiple scattering framework. An individual scattering is referred to as Pomeron, identified with a parton ladder, eventually showing up as flux tubes (or strings). Each parton ladder is composed of a pQCD hard process, plus initial and final state linear parton emission. Nonlinear effects are considered by using saturation scales \$Q\_\{s\}\$, depending on the energy and the number of participants connected to the Pomeron in question. We compute transverse momentum (\$p\_\{t\}\$) spectra of pions, kaons, protons, lambdas, and \$\textbackslash Xi\$ baryons in p-Pb and p-p scattering, compared to experimental data and many other models. In this way we show in a quantitative fashion that p-Pb data (and even p-p ones) show the typical ``flow effect'' of enhanced particle production at intermediate \$p\_\{t\}\$ values, more and more visible with increasing hadron mass.},

  abstract = {THERMUS is a package of C++ classes and functions allowing statistical-thermal model analyses of particle production in relativistic heavy-ion collisions to be performed within the ROOT framework of analysis. Calculations are possible within three statistical ensembles; a grand-canonical treatment of the conserved charges B, S and Q, a fully canonical treatment of the conserved charges, and a mixed-canonical ensemble combining a canonical treatment of strangeness with a grand-canonical treatment of baryon number and electric charge. THERMUS allows for the assignment of decay chains and detector efficiencies specific to each particle yield, which enables sensible fitting of model parameters to experimental data. Program summary Program title: THERMUS, version 2.1 Catalogue identifier: AEBW\_v1\_0 Program summary URL: http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/summaries/AEBW\_v1\_0.html Program obtainable from: CPC Program Library, Queen's University, Belfast, N.

A set of thermal parameters (the number depending on the particular model imposed) and a set of thermalized particles, with their decays specified, is required as input to these models. The output is then a complete set of primordial thermal quantities for each particle, together with the contributions to the final particle yields from resonance decay. In many applications of statistical-thermal models it is required to fit experimental particle multiplicities or particle ratios. In such analyses, the input is a set of experimental yields and ratios, a set of particles comprising the assumed hadron resonance gas formed in the collision and the constraints to be placed on the system. The thermal model parameters consistent with the specified constraints leading to the best-fit to the experimental data are then output. Solution method: THERMUS is a package designed for incorporation into the ROOT [2] framework, used extensively by the heavy-ion community. As such, it utilizes a great deal of ROOT's functionality in its operation. ROOT features used in THERMUS include its containers, the wrapper TMinuit implementing the MINUIT fitting package, and the TMath class of mathematical functions and routines. Arguably the most useful feature is the utilization of CINT as the control language, which allows interactive access to the THERMUS objects. Three distinct statistical ensembles are included in THERMUS, while additional options to include quantum statistics, resonance width and excluded volume corrections are also available. THERMUS provides a default particle list including all mesons (up to the K4{${_\ast}$} (2045)) and baryons (up to the {$\Omega-$}) listed in the July 2002 Particle Physics Booklet [3]. For each typically unstable particle in this list, THERMUS includes a text-file listing its decays. With thermal parameters specified, THERMUS calculates primordial thermal densities either by performing numerical integrations or else, in the case of the Boltzmann approximation without resonance width in the grand-canonical ensemble, by evaluating Bessel functions. Particle decay chains are then used to evaluate experimental observables (i.e. particle yields following resonance decay). Additional detector efficiency factors allow fine-tuning of the model predictions to a specific detector arrangement. When parameters are required to be constrained, use is made of the `Numerical Recipes in C' [1] function which applies the Broyden globally convergent secant method of solving nonlinear systems of equations. Since the NRC software is not freely-available, it has to be purchased by the user. THERMUS provides the means of imposing a large number of constraints on the chosen model (amongst others, THERMUS can fix the baryon-to-charge ratio of the system, the strangeness density of the system and the primordial energy per hadron). Fits to experimental data are accomplished in THERMUS by using the ROOT TMinuit class. In its default operation, the standard {$\chi$}2 function is minimized, yielding the set of best-fit thermal parameters. THERMUS allows the assignment of separate decay chains to each experimental input. In this way, the model is able to match the specific feed-down corrections of a particular data set. Running time: Depending on the analysis required, run-times vary from seconds (for the evaluation of particle multiplicities given a set of parameters) to several minutes (for fits to experimental data subject to constraints).

The meson properties are obtained from the spectral densities of mesonic imaginary-time correlation functions. To obtain the correlation functions, we solve the Dyson-Schwinger equations and the inhomogeneous Bethe-Salpeter equations in the leading symmetry-preserving rainbow-ladder approximation. In the chiral limit, the pion and its partner sigma degenerate at the critical temperature \$T\_c\$. At \$T \textbackslash gtrsim T\_c\$, it is found that the pion rapidly dissociates, which signals deconfinement phase transition. Beyond the chiral limit, the pion dissociation temperature can be used to define the pseudo-critical temperature of chiral phase crossover, which is consistent with that obtained by the maximum point of the chiral susceptibility. The parallel analysis for kaon and pseudoscalar \$s\textbackslash bar\{s\}\$ suggests that heavy mesons may survive above \$T\_c\$.},

This is done by comparing for each jet fragment the probability of further perturbative splitting with the density-dependent probability of scattering with the medium. A simple hadronisation mechanism is included. In the absence of medium effects, we validate JEWEL against a set of benchmark jet measurements. For elastic interactions with the medium, we characterise not only the medium-induced modification of the jet, but also the jet-induced modification of the medium. Our main physics result is the observation that collisional and radiative medium modifications lead to characteristic differences in the jet fragmentation pattern, which persist above a soft background cut. We argue that this should allow to disentangle collisional and radiative parton energy loss mechanisms by measuring the n-jet fraction or a class of jet shape observables.},
