%Second: The PDF itself
\cleardoublepage
% Include the PDF. Comment this while writing the thesis, only add later. 
% Options are: all pages, scaled to full width (use 0.95 if that is too high for some reason), with thesis page number
\includepdf[pages=-,pagecommand={}]{papers/paperI.pdf}
% One additional option could be useful: To cut away the margins of the included PDFs use:
% clip,viewport=<left> <bottom> <right> <top>
% To determine the four numbers you can use the ./determineViewport.sh script in the thesis directory.

%\section*{Poster 1:}
%Media-Tryck's suggestion to a poster layout, can be downloaded from \url{https://bildweb.srv.lu.se/login/}.
%Presented 2067 at the \emph{Symposium for time travel} 
%in Berlin, Germany. For further details refer to Paper~\I and
%Sect.~\ref{sec:mainresults}.

% include poster itself. Cropping works as described above for the papers.
