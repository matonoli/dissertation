  abstract = {In particle collider experiments, elementary particle interactions with large momentum transfer produce quarks and gluons (known as partons) whose evolution is governed by the strong force, as described by the theory of quantum chromodynamics (QCD)1. These partons subsequently emit further partons in a process that can be described as a parton shower2, which culminates in the formation of detectable hadrons. Studying the pattern of the parton shower is one of the key experimental tools for testing QCD. This pattern is expected to depend on the mass of the initiating parton, through a phenomenon known as the dead-cone effect, which predicts a suppression of the gluon spectrum emitted by a heavy quark of mass mQ and energy E, within a cone of angular size mQ/E around the emitter3. Previously, a direct observation of the dead-cone effect in QCD had not been possible, owing to the challenge of reconstructing the cascading quarks and gluons from the experimentally accessible hadrons. We report the direct observation of the QCD dead cone by using new iterative declustering techniques4,5 to reconstruct the parton shower of charm quarks. This result confirms a fundamental feature of QCD. Furthermore, the measurement of a dead-cone angle constitutes a direct experimental observation of the non-zero mass of the charm quark, which is a fundamental constant in the standard model of particle physics.},

  abstract = {The production of {$\Lambda$} baryons and KS0 mesons (V0 particles) was measured in p\textendash Pb collisions at sNN=5.02 TeV and pp collisions at s=7 TeV with ALICE at the LHC. The production of these strange particles is studied separately for particles associated with hard scatterings and the underlying event to shed light on the baryon-to-meson ratio enhancement observed at intermediate transverse momentum (pT) in high multiplicity pp and p\textendash Pb collisions. Hard scatterings are selected on an event-by-event basis with jets reconstructed with the anti-kT algorithm using charged particles. The production of strange particles associated with jets pT,jetch{$>$}10 and pT,jetch{$>$}20 GeV/c in p\textendash Pb collisions, and with jet pT,jetch{$>$}10 GeV/c in pp collisions is reported as a function of pT. Its dependence on angular distance from the jet axis, R(V0,jet), for jets with pT,jetch{$>$}10 GeV/c in p\textendash Pb collisions is reported as well. The pT-differential production spectra of strange particles associated with jets are found to be harder compared to that in the underlying event and both differ from the inclusive measurements. In events containing a jet, the density of the V0 particles in the underlying event is found to be larger than the density in the minimum bias events. The {$\Lambda$}/KS0 ratio associated with jets in p\textendash Pb collisions is consistent with the ratio in pp collisions and follows the expectation of jets fragmenting in vacuum. On the other hand, this ratio within jets is consistently lower than the one obtained in the underlying event and it does not show the characteristic enhancement of baryons at intermediate pT often referred to as ``baryon anomaly'' in the inclusive measurements.},

  abstract = {The ALICE experiment was proposed in 1993, to study strongly interacting matter at extreme energy densities via a comprehensive investigation of nuclear collisions at the LHC. Its physics programme initially focused on the determination of the properties of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP), a deconfined state of quarks and gluons and was extended along the years, covering a diverse ensemble of observables related to Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), the theory of strong interactions. The experiment has studied Pb-Pb, Xe-Xe, p-Pb and pp collisions in the multi-TeV energy range, during the Run 1 and Run 2 data taking periods at the LHC (2009-2018). The aim of this review article is to gather and summarise a selection of ALICE physics results and to discuss their implications on the current understanding of the macroscopic and microscopic properties of strongly interacting matter at the highest temperature reached in the laboratory. It will be shown that it is possible to have a quantitative description of the properties of the QGP produced in Pb--Pb collisions. We also show that various features, commonly ascribed to QGP formation, are detected for a wide range of interacting system sizes. Precision measurements of QCD-related observables not directly connected to the study of the QGP will also be discussed. Prospects for future measurements with the ALICE detector and its foreseen upgrades will also be briefly described.},

The multiplicity dependence of \$v\_n\$ is studied in a very wide range from 20 to 3000 particles produced in the mid-rapidity region \$|\textbackslash eta|{$<$}0.8\$ for the transverse momentum range \$0.2 {$<$} p\_\{\textbackslash rm T\} {$<$} 3.0\$ GeV/\$c\$. An ordering of the coefficients \$v\_2 {$>$} v\_3 {$>$} v\_4\$ is found in pp and p-Pb collisions, similar to that seen in large collision systems, while a weak \$v\_2\$ multiplicity dependence is observed relative to nucleus-nucleus collisions in the same multiplicity range. Using a novel subevent method, \$v\_\{2\}\$ measured with four-particle cumulants is found to be compatible with that from six-particle cumulants in pp and p-Pb collisions. The magnitude of the correlation between \$v\_n\^2\$ and \$v\_m\^2\$, evaluated with the symmetric cumulants SC\$(m,n)\$ is observed to be positive at all multiplicities for \$v\_2\$ and \$v\_4\$, while for \$v\_2\$ and \$v\_3\$ it is negative and changes sign for multiplicities below 100, which may indicate a different \$v\_n\$ fluctuation pattern in this multiplicity range. The observed long-range multi-particle azimuthal correlations in high multiplicity pp and p-Pb collisions can neither be described by PYTHIA 8 nor by IP-Glasma+MUSIC+UrQMD model calculations, and hence provide new insights into the understanding of collective effects in small collision systems.},

In order to avoid auto-correlation biases, the actual transverse momentum (\$p\_\{\textbackslash rm\{T\}\}\$) spectra of the particles under study and the event activity are measured in different rapidity windows. In the highest multiplicity class, the charged-particle density reaches about 3.5 times the value measured in inelastic collisions. While the yield of protons normalized to pions remains approximately constant as a function of multiplicity, the corresponding ratios of strange hadrons to pions show a significant enhancement that increases with increasing strangeness content. Furthermore, all identified particle to pion ratios are shown to depend solely on charged-particle multiplicity density, regardless of system type and collision energy. The evolution of the spectral shapes with multiplicity and hadron mass shows patterns that are similar to those observed in p-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions at LHC energies. The obtained \$p\_\{\textbackslash rm\{T\}\}\$ distributions and yields are compared to expectations from QCD-based pp event generators as well as to predictions from thermal and hydrodynamic models. These comparisons indicate that traces of a collective, equilibrated system are already present in high-multiplicity pp collisions.},

The measured \$\{p\_\{\textbackslash rm T\}\}\$ distributions are compared to the expectations from a Blast-Wave model. The parameters which describe the production of lighter hadron species also describe the hyperon spectra in high multiplicity p-Pb. The yield of hyperons relative to charged pions is studied and compared with results from pp and Pb-Pb collisions. A statistical model is employed, which describes the change in the ratios with volume using a canonical suppression mechanism, in which the small volume causes a species-dependent relative reduction of hadron production. The calculations, in which the magnitude of the effect depends on the strangeness content, show good qualitative agreement with the data.},

Particle transverse momentum (\$p\_\{\textbackslash rm T\}\$) spectra are measured in the ``toward'', ``transverse'', and ``away'' angular regions defined with respect to the direction of the leading particle in the event. While the toward and away regions contain the fragmentation products of the near-side and away-side jets, respectively, the transverse region is dominated by particles from the Underlying Event (UE). The relative transverse activity classifier, \$R\_\{\textbackslash rm T\} = N\_\{\textbackslash rm T\} / \textbackslash langle N\_\{\textbackslash rm T\} \textbackslash rangle\$, is used to group events according to their UE activity, where \$N\_\{\textbackslash rm T\}\$ is the measured charged-particle multiplicity per event in the transverse region and \$\textbackslash langle N\_\{\textbackslash rm T\} \textbackslash rangle\$ is the mean value over all the analysed events. The first measurements of identified particle \$p\_\{\textbackslash rm T\}\$ spectra as a function of \$R\_\{\textbackslash rm T\}\$ in the three topological regions are reported. The yield of high transverse momentum particles relative to the \$R\_\{\textbackslash rm T\}\$-integrated measurement decreases with increasing \$R\_\{\textbackslash rm T\}\$ in both the toward and away regions, indicating that the softer UE dominates particle production as \$R\_\{\textbackslash rm T\}\$ increases and validating that \$R\_\{\textbackslash rm T\}\$ can be used to control the magnitude of the UE. Conversely, the spectral shapes in the transverse region harden significantly with increasing \$R\_\{\textbackslash rm T\}\$. This hardening follows a mass ordering, being more significant for heavier particles. The \$p\_\{\textbackslash rm T\}\$-differential particle ratios \$(\{\textbackslash rm p + \textbackslash overline\{p\}\})/(\textbackslash pi\^+ + \textbackslash pi\^-)\$ and \$(\{\textbackslash rm K\^+ + K\^-\})/(\textbackslash pi\^+ + \textbackslash pi\^-)\$ in the low UE limit \$(R\_\{\textbackslash rm T\} \textbackslash rightarrow 0)\$ approach expectations from Monte Carlo generators such as PYTHIA 8 and EPOS LHC, where the jet-fragmentation models have been tuned to reproduce \$\{\textbackslash rm e\^+ e\^-\}\$ results.},

The inclusive production of the same particle species and the corresponding ratios are also reported. The production of multi-strange hadrons, \$\textbackslash Xi\^\{\textbackslash pm\}\$ and \$\textbackslash Omega\^\{\textbackslash pm\}\$, and their associated particle ratios in jets and in the underlying event are measured for the first time. In both pp and p-Pb collisions, the baryon-to-meson and baryon-to-baryon yield ratios measured in jets differ from the inclusive particle production for low and intermediate hadron \$p\_\{\textbackslash rm T\}\$ (0.6\$-\$6 GeV/\$c\$). Ratios measured in the underlying event are in turn similar to those measured for inclusive particle production. In pp collisions, the particle production in jets is compared with PYTHIA 8 predictions with three colour-reconnection implementation modes. None of them fully reproduces the data in the measured hadron \$p\_T\$ region. The maximum deviation is observed for \$\textbackslash Xi\^\{\textbackslash pm\}\$ and \$\textbackslash Omega\^\{\textbackslash pm\}\$, which reaches a factor of about six. In p-Pb collisions, there is no significant event-multiplicity dependence for particle production in jets, in contrast to what is observed in the underlying event. The presented measurements provide novel constraints on hadronisation and its Monte Carlo description. In particular, they demonstrate that the fragmentation of jets alone is insufficient to describe the strange and multi-strange particle production in hadronic collisions at LHC energies.},

The mean sphericity as a function of the charged particle multiplicity at mid-rapidity (\$N\_\{\textbackslash rm ch\}\$) is reported for events with different \$p\_\{\textbackslash rm T\}\$ scales ("soft" and "hard") defined by the transverse momentum of the leading particle. In addition, the mean charged particle transverse momentum versus multiplicity is presented for the different event classes, and the sphericity distributions in bins of multiplicity are presented. The data are compared with calculations of standard Monte Carlo event generators. The transverse sphericity is found to grow with multiplicity at all collision energies, with a steeper rise at low \$N\_\{\textbackslash rm ch\}\$, whereas the event generators show the opposite tendency. The combined study of the sphericity and the mean \$p\_\{\textbackslash rm T\}\$ with multiplicity indicates that most of the tested event generators produce events with higher multiplicity by generating more back-to-back jets resulting in decreased sphericity (and isotropy). The PYTHIA6 generator with tune PERUGIA-2011 exhibits a noticeable improvement in describing the data, compared to the other tested generators.},

The Toward and Away regions collect the fragmentation products of the hardest partonic interaction. The Transverse region is expected to be most sensitive to the Underlying Event activity. The study is performed with charged particles above three different pT thresholds: 0.15, 0.5 and 1.0 GeV/c.

  abstract = {This article reports measurements characterizing the Unde{$\surd$}rlying Event (UE) associated with hard scatterings at midrapidity (|{$\eta$}| {$<$} 0.8) in pp collisions at s = 13 TeV. The hard scatterings are identified by the leading particle, the charged particle with the highest transverse momentum (plTeading) in the event. Charged-particle number-densities and summed transverse-momentum densities are measured in different azimuthal regions defined with respect to the leading particle direction: Toward, Transverse, and Away. The Toward and Away regions contain the fragmentation products of the hard scatterings in addition to the UE contribution, whereas particles in the Transverse region are expected to originate predominantly from the UE. The study is performed as a function of plTeading with three different pT thresholds for the associated particles, ptTrack {$>$} 0.15, 0.5, and 1.0 GeV/c. The charged-particle density in the Transverse region rises steeply for low values of plTeadingand reaches a plateau. The results confirm{$\surd$}the trend that the charged-particle density in the Transverse region shows a stronger increase with s than the inclusive charged-particle density at midrapidity. The UE activity is increased by approximately 20\% when going from 7 TeV to 13 TeV pp collisions. The plateau in the Transverse region (5 {$<$} plTeading {$<$} 40 GeV/c) is further characterized by the probability distribution of its charged-particle multiplicity normalized to its average value (relative transverse activity, RT) and the mean transverse momentum as a function of RT. Experimental results are compared to model calculations using PYTHIA 8 and EPOS LHC. The overall agreement between models and data is within 30\%. These measurements provide new insights on the interplay between hard scatterings and the associated UE in pp collisions.},

The event activity, quantified by charged-particle number and summed-\$p\_\{\textbackslash rm T\}\$ densities, is measured as a function of the leading-particle transverse momentum (\$p\_\{\textbackslash rm T\}\^\{\textbackslash rm trig\}\$). These quantities are studied in three azimuthal-angle regions relative to the leading particle in the event: toward, away, and transverse. Results are presented for three different \$p\_\{\textbackslash rm T\}\$ thresholds (0.15, 0.5, and 1 GeV/\$c\$) at mid-pseudorapidity (\$|\textbackslash eta|{$<$}0.8\$). The event activity in the transverse region, which is the most sensitive to the underlying event, exhibits similar behaviour in both pp and p\$-\$Pb collisions, namely, a steep increase with \$p\_\{\textbackslash rm T\}\^\{\textbackslash rm trig\}\$ for low \$p\_\{\textbackslash rm T\}\^\{\textbackslash rm trig\}\$, followed by a saturation at \$p\_\{\textbackslash rm T\}\^\{\textbackslash rm trig\} \textbackslash approx 5\$ GeV/\$c\$. The results from pp collisions are compared with existing measurements at other centre-of-mass energies. The quantities in the toward and away regions are also analyzed after the subtraction of the contribution measured in the transverse region. The remaining jet-like particle densities are consistent in pp and p\$-\$Pb collisions for \$p\_\{\textbackslash rm T\}\^\{\textbackslash rm trig\}{$>$}10\$ GeV/\$c\$, whereas for lower \$p\_\{\textbackslash rm T\}\^\{\textbackslash rm trig\}\$ values the event activity is slightly higher in p\$-\$Pb than in pp collisions.

A new method to correct for acceptance limitations and inefficiencies based on the principle of maximum entropy has been used. Multiplicity distributions in full phase space and in intervals of pseudorapidity are presented in tabular form. The violation of KNO scaling in full phase space found by the UA5 group at an energy of 546 GeV is confirmed also at 200 and 900 GeV. The shape of the 900 GeV distribution in full phase space is narrower in the peak region than at 200 GeV but exhibits a pronounced high multiplicity tail. The negative binomial distribution fits data at 200 GeV in all pseudorapidity intervals and in small intervals at 900 GeV. In large intervals at 900 GeV, however, the negative binomial distribution.

The distributions were constructed using charged particles with absolute pseudorapidity less than 2.5 and with transverse momentum greater than 500 MeV, in events with at least one such charged particle with transverse momentum above 1 GeV. These distributions characterise the angular distribution of energy and particle flows with respect to the charged particle with highest transverse momentum, as a function of both that momentum and of charged-particle multiplicity. The results have been corrected for detector effects and are compared to the predictions of various Monte Carlo event generators, experimentally establishing the level of underlying-event activity at LHC Run 2 energies and providing inputs for the development of event generator modelling.

This is the first time that such a matching has been carried out for hadronic final-state observables at hadron colliders. We compare our results to Monte Carlo predictions, with and without matching to multi-parton tree-level fixed-order calculations. These studies suggest that hadron-collider event shapes have significant scope for constraining both perturbative and non-perturbative aspects of hadron-collider QCD. The differences between various calculational methods also highlight the limits of relying on simultaneous variations of renormalisation and factorisation scale in making reliable estimates of uncertainties in QCD predictions. We also discuss the sensitivity of event shapes to the topology of multi-jet events, which are expected to appear in many New Physics scenarios.},

These data were obtained using the CLEO detector at the Cornell Electron Storage Ring (CESR) and provide information on the production of {$\pi$}, K, {$\rho$}, K*, {$\varphi$}, p, {$\Lambda$}, and {$\Xi$} in quark and gluon jets. The average multiplicity of hadrons per event for upsilon decays (compared with continuum annihilations) is 11.4 (10.5) pions, 2.4 (2.2) kaons, 0.6 (0.5) {$\rho$}0, 1.2 (0.8) K*, 0.6 (0.4) protons and antiprotons, 0.15 (0.08) {$\varphi$}, 0.19 (0.07) {$\Lambda$} and {$\Lambda$}\textasciimacron, and 0.016 (0.005) {$\Xi-$} and {$\Xi$}\textasciimacron{} +. We have also seen evidence for {$\eta$} and f0 production. The most significant differences between upsilon and continuum final states are (1) the inclusive energy spectra fall off more rapidly with increasing particle energy in upsilon decays, (2) the production of heavier particles, especially baryons, is not as strongly suppressed in upsilon decays, and (3) baryon and antibaryon are more likely to be correlated at long range in upsilon decay than in continuum events.},

The study is performed as a function of the relative transverse activity classifier, R T, which is the relative charged-particle multiplicity in the transverse region ({$\pi$}/3 {$<$} |{$\phi$} trig. - {$\phi$} assoc.| {$<$} 2{$\pi$}/3) of the di-hadron correlations, and it is sensitive to the multi-parton interactions. The evolution of the yield of associated particles on both the towards and the away regions ( GeV/c) as a function of R T is investigated. We propose a strategy which allows for the modelling and subtraction of the underlying event contribution from the towards and the away regions in challenging environments like those characterised by large R T. We found that the signal in the away region becomes broader with increasing R T, while its corresponding yield is independent of R T. Contrarily, the yield increases with R T in the towards region. This effect is reminiscent of that seen in heavy-ion collisions, where an enhancement of the yield in the towards region for 0\%\textendash 5\% central Pb\textendash Pb collisions at TeV was reported. A discussion on the origin of these effects in PYTHIA, as well as their implications for the interpretation of recent LHC results for pp collisions, is presented.},

  abstract = {This manual describes the PYTHIA 8.3 event generator, the most recent version of an evolving physics tool used to answer fundamental questions in particle physics. The program is most often used to generate high-energy-physics collision "events", i.e. sets of particles produced in association with the collision of two incoming high-energy particles, but has several uses beyond that. The guiding philosophy is to produce and reproduce properties of experimentally obtained collisions as accurately as possible. The program includes a wide ranges of reactions within and beyond the Standard Model, and extending to heavy ion physics. Emphasis is put on phenomena where strong interactions play a major role. The manual contains both pedagogical and practical components. All included physics models are described in enough detail to allow the user to obtain a cursory overview of used assumptions and approximations, enabling an informed evaluation of the program output. A number of the most central algorithms are described in enough detail that the main results of the program can be reproduced independently, allowing further development of existing models or the addition of new ones. Finally, a chapter dedicated fully to the user is included towards the end, providing pedagogical examples of standard use cases, and a detailed description of a number of external interfaces. The program code, the online manual, and the latest version of this print manual can be found on the PYTHIA web page: https://www.pythia.org/},

  abstract = {In models for hadron collisions based on string hadronization, the strings are usually treated as independent, allowing no interaction between the confined colour fields. In studies of nucleus collisions it has been suggested that strings close in space can fuse to form "colour ropes". Such ropes are expected to give more strange particles and baryons, which also has been suggested as a signal for plasma formation. Overlapping strings can also be expected in pp collisions, where usually no phase transition is expected. In particular at the high LHC energies the expected density of strings is quite high. To investigate possible effects of rope formation, we present a model in which strings are allowed to combine into higher multiplets, giving rise to increased production of baryons and strangeness, or recombine into singlet structures and vanish. Also a crude model for strings recombining into junction structures is considered, again giving rise to increased baryon production. The models are implemented in the DIPSY MC event generator, using PYTHIA 8 for hadronization, and comparison to pp minimum bias data, reveals improvement in the description of identified particle spectra.},

  abstract = {By studying p-p collisions we hope to improve our understanding of the fundamental constituents of matter and how they form into colorless objects. Measurements of the inclusive jet cross-sections and fragmentation properties have confirmed that QCD based calculations give a good description of the hard scattering processes. However, as our analysis of jets has improved it has become clear that there is significant contribution to these measurements from processes other than those directly related to the initial hard scattering - the so-called underlying event. Several processes contribute to the underlying event, namely the beam-beam remnants, initial and final state radiation and multiple parton interactions. The structure of the jet and the underlying event are strikingly different in both their particle compositions and momentum distributions. Only by understanding both components can one fully describe a p-p collision. I will discuss preliminary results from studies of the underlying event in p-p collisions at sqrt(s) = 200 GeV at RHIC, and compare to PYTHIA predictions, as well as earlier results from the Tevatron at 1.8-1.96 TeV.},

A variety of leading (highest transverse momentum) charged jet observables are compared with the QCD Monte Carlo models HERWIG, ISAJET, and PYTHIA. The models describe fairly well the multiplicity distribution of charged particles within the leading charged jet, the size of the leading charged jet, the radial distribution of charged particles and transverse momentum around the leading charged jet direction, and the momentum distribution of charged particles within the leading charged jet. The direction of the leading ``charged particle jet'' in each event is used to define three regions of {$\eta-\varphi$} space. The ``toward'' region contains the leading ``charged particle jet,'' while the ``away'' region, on the average, contains the away-side jet. The ``transverse'' region is perpendicular to the plane of the hard 2-to-2 scattering and is very sensitive to the ``underlying event'' component of the QCD Monte Carlo models. HERWIG, ISAJET, and PYTHIA with their default parameters do not describe correctly all the properties of the ``transverse'' region.},

The second-order (v[2]) and third-order (v[3]) azimuthal anisotropy harmonics of unidentified charged particles, as well as v[2] of K0 short and Lambda/anti-Lambda particles, are extracted from long-range two-particle correlations as functions of particle multiplicity and transverse momentum. For high-multiplicity pp events, a mass ordering is observed for the v[2] values of charged hadrons (mostly pions), K0 short, and Lambda/anti-Lambda, with lighter particle species exhibiting a stronger azimuthal anisotropy signal below pt of about 2 GeV/c. For 13 TeV data, the v[2] signals are also extracted from four- and six-particle correlations for the first time in pp collisions, with comparable magnitude to those from two-particle correlations. These observations are similar to those seen in pPb and PbPb collisions, and support the interpretation of a collective origin for the observed long-range correlations in high-multiplicity pp collisions.},

The nuclear modification factors, R\$\_\textbackslash mathrm\{AA\}\$, derived from the PbPb-to-pp ratio of yields for each state, are studied as functions of meson rapidity and transverse momentum, as well as PbPb collision centrality. The yields of all three states are found to be significantly suppressed, and compatible with a sequential ordering of the suppression, R\$\_\textbackslash mathrm\{AA\}\$(\$\textbackslash Upsilon\$(1S)) \${$>\$$} R\$\_\textbackslash mathrm\{AA\}\$(\$\textbackslash Upsilon\$(2S)) \${$>\$$} R\$\_\textbackslash mathrm\{AA\}\$(\$\textbackslash Upsilon\$(3S)) . The suppression of \$\textbackslash Upsilon\$(1S) is larger than that seen at \$\textbackslash sqrt\{s\_\{\_\textbackslash mathrm\{NN\}\}\} =\$ 2.76 TeV, although the two are compatible within uncertainties. The upper limit on the R\$\_\textbackslash mathrm\{AA\}\$ of \$\textbackslash Upsilon\$(3S) integrated over \$p\_\textbackslash mathrm\{T\}\$ and rapidity is 0.094 at 95\% confidence level, which is the strongest suppression observed for any hadron species in heavy ion collisions to date.},

The combined data set considered in this report corresponds to a total luminosity of about 3~fb-1 collected by the four LEP experiments ALEPH, DELPHI, L3 and OPAL, at centre-of-mass energies ranging from 130~GeV to 209~GeV. Combining the published results of the four LEP experiments, the measurements include total and differential cross-sections in photon-pair, fermion-pair and four-fermion production, the latter resulting from both double-resonant WW and ZZ production as well as singly resonant production. Total and differential cross-sections are measured precisely, providing a stringent test of the Standard Model at centre-of-mass energies never explored before in electron\textendash positron collisions. Final-state interaction effects in four-fermion production, such as those arising from colour reconnection and Bose\textendash Einstein correlations between the two W decay systems arising in WW production, are searched for and upper limits on the strength of possible effects are obtained.

In these proceedings, the latest measurements of the    {$\Upsilon$}    production suppression in Au + Au collisions at       s NN   = 200     GeV via the di-muon and di-electron decay channels by the STAR experiment at RHIC are presented and compared with data from the LHC and theoretical calculations. Moreover,    {$\Upsilon$}    production measurements in p + p and p + Au collisions are also reported, providing a baseline and a quantification of the cold nuclear matter effects, respectively.},

Quarkonium suppression in the medium due to the colour screening effect has been viewed as a direct evidence of the formation of such matter. Moreover, different quarkonium states are expected to dissociate at different temperatures, which can be used to constrain the medium temperature. At RHIC energies, other effects, such as regeneration and co-mover absorption, are expected to be very small for the bottomonium family, which makes it a cleaner probe compared to the \$J/\textbackslash psi\$ meson.

This model is used to calculate "geometric" quantities, which are typically expressed as impact parameter (b), number of participating nucleons (N\_part) and number of binary nucleon-nucleon collisions (N\_coll). A brief history of the original Glauber model is presented, with emphasis on its development into the purely classical, geometric picture that is used for present-day data analyses. Distinctions are made between the "optical limit" and Monte Carlo approaches, which are often used interchangably but have some essential differences in particular contexts. The methods used by the four RHIC experiments are compared and contrasted, although the end results are reassuringly similar for the various geometric observables. Finally, several important RHIC measurements are highlighted that rely on geometric quantities, estimated from Glauber calculations, to draw insight from experimental observables. The status and future of Glauber modeling in the next generation of heavy ion physics studies is briefly discussed.},

  abstract = {Through ultrarelativistic particle collisions at the LHC, it is possible to deconfine quarks and gluons. This deconfinement gives rise to a strongly interacting medium, referred to as the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). One of the earliest proposed and observed signatures of the QGP was the enhanced production of strange hadrons since the medium can thermally produce strange quarks. However, recent studies in small systems, such as proton\textendash proton (pp) and proton-lead (pPb) collisions, have exhibited similar features. These findings arequite puzzling, as the formation of a QGP in these small collision systems challenges current theoretical frameworks.In this Thesis, I present two different studies on the production of {$\varphi$} mesons, in relation to {$\Xi$} baryons, in pp collisions at {$\surd$}s = 13 TeV, measured with the ALICE apparatus. Both of these studies aim to investigate the origin of strange hadron enhancement in high-multiplicity pp collisions. First, I report measurements of {$\varphi$} production as a function of the event-shape observable Unweighted Transverse Spherocity, SOpT=1. With SOpT=1 , it is possible to categorize events by their azimuthal topology. I utilize SOpT=1 to contrast particle production in collisionsdominated by many soft initial interactions, with collisions dominated by a single hard scattering. I find that strangeness enhancement is prominent in soft, isotropic topologies, whereas events with di-jet topologies showcase a clear suppression of strange particles.The second study presents the production of {$\varphi$} mesons and {$\Xi$} hadrons as a function of the Relative Transverse Activity RT . With RT , one can control the size of the Underlying Event (UE). By varying RT, it is therefore possible to study the interplay between particle production from hard fragmentation in jets, and soft particles produced by the UE. The reported results suggest that strange particle production is mainly a feature of the UE. When put together, the two studies suggest that high-multiplicity pp collisions are in general dominated by soft physics, which is also responsible for the strangeness enhancement, whilehigh-multiplicity events dominated by hard physics are rare outliers.},

This region has contributions from the Underlying Event (UE) as well as from Initial- and Final-State Radiation (ISR-FSR). Based on the data, a two-component model is built. This has the functional form \$\textbackslash propto s\^\{\textbackslash alpha\}+\textbackslash beta\textbackslash log(s)\$, where the logarithmic ((\$\textbackslash beta = 0.140 \textbackslash pm 0.007\$)) and the power-law (\$\textbackslash alpha = 0.270 \textbackslash pm 0.005\$) terms describe the components more sensitive to the ISR-FSR and UE contributions, respectively. The model describes the data from RHIC to LHC energies, the extrapolation to higher energies indicates that at around \$\textbackslash sqrt\{s\} \textbackslash approx 100\$\textbackslash,TeV the number density associated to UE will match that from ISR-FSR. Although this behaviour is not predicted by PYTHIA\textasciitilde 8.244, the power-law behaviour of the UE contribution is consistent with the energy dependence of the parameter that regulates Multiparton Interactions. Using simulations, KNO-like scaling properties of the multiplicity distributions in the regions sensitive to either UE or ISR-FSR are also discussed. The results presented here can be helpful to constrain QCD-inspired Monte Carlo models at the Future Circular Collider energies, as well as to characterize the UE-based event classifiers which are currently used at the LHC.},

  abstract = {Multiparton interactions (MPI) in pp collisions have attracted the attention of the heavy-ion community since they can help to elucidate the origin of collectivelike effects discovered in small collision systems at the LHC. In this work, we report that in pythia8.244, the charged-particle production in events with a large number of MPI (Nmpi) normalized to that obtained in minimum-bias pp collisions shows interesting features. After the normalization to the corresponding {$\langle$}Nmpi{$\rangle$}, the ratios as a function of pT exhibit a bump at pT{$\approx$}3 GeV/c; and for higher pT ({$>$}8 GeV/c), the ratios are independent of Nmpi. While the size of the bump increases with increasing Nmpi, the behavior at high pT is expected from the ``binary scaling'' (parton-parton interactions), which holds given the absence of any parton-energy loss mechanism in pythia. The bump at intermediate pT is reminiscent of the Cronin effect observed for the nuclear modification factor in p-Pb collisions. In order to unveil these effects in data, we propose a strategy to construct an event classifier sensitive to MPI using machine learning-based regression. The study is conducted using TMVA, and the regression is performed with boosted decision trees (BDT). Event properties like forward charged-particle multiplicity, transverse spherocity and the average transverse momentum ({$\langle$}pT{$\rangle$}) are used for training. The kinematic cuts are defined in accordance with the ALICE detector capabilities. For the validation of the method and to find possible model dependence, we also compare the results from pythia8.244 with herwig7.1. In addition, we also report that if we apply the trained BDT on existing (INEL{$>$}0) pp data, i.e., events with at least one primary charged-particle within |{$\eta$}|{$<$}1, the average number of MPI in pp collisions at {$\surd$}s=5.02 and 13 TeV are 3.76{$\pm$}1.01 and 4.65{$\pm$}1.01, respectively.},

We describe the changes required to the model to reproduce in detail the new data available from LHC and the consequences in the interpretation of these data. In particular we discuss the effect of the collective hadronization in p-p scattering. A different parametrization of flow has been introduced in the case of a small volume with high density of thermalized matter (core) reached in p-p compared to large volume produced in heavy ion collisions. Both parametrizations depend only on the geometry and the amount of secondary particles entering in the core and not on the beam mass or energy. The transition between the two flow regimes can be tested with p-Pb data. EPOS LHC is able to reproduce all minimum bias},

The observed pattern of hadrosynthesis corresponds to that of an ideal resonance gas in equilibrium at the pseudo-critical temperature determined in QCD. The critical behavior of QCD is encoded in the fluctuation patterns of conserved quantum numbers, which are presently being measured.

Typical aspects considered are multiparton interactions, colour reconnection, and hadronization. Of special interest are non-universal features of hadronization at the LHC, such as the recently observed enhancement of charm and bottom baryons, and the bottom baryon asymmetry, as well as the some years earlier observed strangeness enhancement. Several new production mechanisms, such as junction reconnection, ropes and shove, have been proposed to address some of these issues. Alternatively, an admixture of a quark--gluon plasma component also in pp collisions is introduced in the core--corona approach.},

We observe a clear suppression of the correlated yields of back-to-back {$\pi$}0 pairs in p+Al and p+Au collisions compared to the p+p data. The observed suppression of back-to-back pairs as a function of transverse momentum suggests nonlinear gluon dynamics arising at high parton densities. The larger suppression found in p+Au relative to p+Al collisions exhibits a dependence of the saturation scale Q2s on the mass number A. A linear scaling of the suppression with A1/3 is observed with a slope of -0.09{$\pm$}0.01.},

One of the central features of the standard model is a field that permeates all of space and interacts with fundamental particles5\textendash 9. The quantum excitation of this field, known as the Higgs field, manifests itself as the Higgs boson, the only fundamental particle with no spin. In 2012, a particle with properties consistent with the Higgs boson of the standard model~was observed by the ATLAS and CMS experiments at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN10,11. Since then, more than 30\,times as many Higgs bosons have been recorded by the ATLAS experiment, enabling much more precise measurements and new tests of the theory. Here, on the basis of this larger dataset, we combine an unprecedented number of production and decay processes of the Higgs boson to scrutinize its interactions with elementary particles. Interactions with gluons, photons, and W and Z bosons\textemdash the carriers of the strong, electromagnetic and weak forces\textemdash are studied in detail. Interactions with three third-generation matter particles (bottom (b) and top (t) quarks, and~tau leptons ({$\tau$})) are well measured and indications of interactions with a second-generation particle (muons, {$\mu$}) are emerging. These tests reveal that the Higgs boson discovered ten years ago is remarkably consistent with the predictions of the theory and provide stringent constraints on many models of new phenomena beyond the standard model.},

  abstract = {High-energy heavy-ion collisions allow the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) production and study, a state of high-density QCD matter in which quarks and gluons are no longer confined inside hadrons for a very short time. Different observables reveal an enhanced production of strange hadrons, signatures of collective effects and opacity to jets due to the QGP formation. However, collective effects and strangeness enhancement are also observed in pp and p-Pb collisions (small systems) with high charged-particle multiplicity. These observations in small systems are very puzzling since the QGP is not expected to be formed since the small systems are considered too dilute and too short-lived.In this thesis, I present a study on the production of {$\pi$}, K and p in pp collisions at {$\surd$}s = 13 TeV using data recorded by the ALICE experiment. To investigate the origins of collective effects and strangeness enhancement, I measure the particle production as a function of the Relative Transverse Activity (RT) and the Transverse Spherocity (S0). In the RT analysis, particle production is measured in different topological regions (toward, away, and transverse) with respect to the leading charged track per event. The toward and away regions mainly contain the fragmentation products of the jet, while the Underlying Event dominates the transverse. The transverse momentum spectra and K/{$\pi$} and p/{$\pi$} ratios are measured as a function of RT = NT/{$\langle$}NT{$\rangle$}, where NT is the charged-particle multiplicity in the transverse region. It is observed that the K/{$\pi$} and p/{$\pi$} ratios increase with increasing RT in the toward region, while little RT dependence is observed in the transverse. Models tuned to e+e- results describe the low-RT particle ratios qualitatively.The transverse spherocity is an event shape observable that can disentangle jet-like from isotropic topologies. I studied particle production in high-multiplicity events as a function of spherocity. I contrast the results obtained using a forward and a mid-pseudorapidity multiplicity estimator. The results show that the mid-pseudorapidity estimator combined with the spherocity selection allows selecting events with more significant variations in the average transverse momentum ({$\langle$}pT{$\rangle$}) than the forward estimator. I present the pT spectra and particle ratios as a function of S0. Finally, all the data results are contrasted with microscopic models.},
