\section{Collisions of heavy nuclei}

\subsection{Collision geometry, Centrality, multiplicity}

Collisions of heavy nuclei, composed of many fluctuating nucleons, may occur under various initial state configurations. Some quantities used to describe them are the impact parameter $b$, defined as the distance between the two nuclei centers, number of participating (scattered) nucleons $\Npart$, and the number of binary nucleonic collisions $\Ncoll$.

Determining these quantities is important because:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Soft processes, such as light flavor particle production, are expected to scale with the interaction volume, which $\propto \Npart$.
\item Hard processes, such as jet and heavy flavor production, are expected to scale with the number of large momentum transfer interactions given by \Ncoll.
\item $b$, disregarding the fluctuations of nucleonic positions, defines the shape and anisotropy of the overlap region, which are important initial state conditions.
\end{enumerate}

Since these quantities cannot be directly measured, they need to be modelled. The charged particle \textit{multiplicity} is commonly used for this purpose, as \meanNch increases monotonically with \Npart, \Ncoll, and decreasing $b$. Multiplicity \Nch can be measured experimentally, e.g.\ with tracking detectors. The concept of \textit{centrality} is also used, which is defined as quantiles of the total nuclear cross-section. For example, a centrality of $0-5\%$ refers to low $b$ values and the top $5\%$ of \Nch values (central events), while $95-100\%$ centrality refers to high $b$ values and the bottom $5\%$ of \Nch values (peripheral events). Centrality can also be inferred from other \textit{event activity} classifiers, such as amplitudes of scintillators at forward rapidity, transverse energy in calorimeters, or energy from beam remnants in zero-degree-calorimeters.

In AA collisions, these relationships are well-defined, and thus the models perform well. The most popular model is the MC Glauber model. Other models include MC-KLN and IP Glasma.

\end{figure}

\subsection{MC Glauber model}

The MC Glauber model takes on a very simple albeit powerful approach. The two nuclei are simulated in three dimensions in a way that satisfies their respective nuclear density profiles, usually modelled by sampling the positions of nucleons from the Wood-Saxon distribution:

\begin{minipage}{0.5\linewidth}
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzpicture}
            \draw[->] (-0.25,0) -- (2.5,0) node[right] {$r$};
            \draw[->] (0,-0.2) -- (0,1.2) node[above] {$n(r)$};
            \draw[scale=1,domain=-0.15:2.2,smooth,variable=\x,blue] plot ({\x},{1/(1+exp((\x-1.5)/0.1))});
            \draw[dashed] (1.5,0) node[below] {$R$} -- (1.5,1);
        \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
\end{minipage}%
\begin{minipage}{0.5\linewidth}
    \begin{equation}
        n(r) = \frac{1}{1+\exp((r-R)/a)} \quad ,
    \end{equation}
\end{minipage}

where $R$ is the nuclear radius and $a$ the nuclear skin thickness.

The nucleonic densities can be represented by uniform disks, or more accurately by Fermi-distributions or Gaussian profiles to account for fluctuations of their densities. Their parameters are left free and are tuned to the data.

A random impact parameter is then chosen or sampled. The collision is then treated as a sequence of independent binary nucleon-nucleon collisions, where
\begin{enumerate}
\item nucleons remain travelling in straight lines,
\item the inelastic nucleon-nucleon cross section $\sigma_\mathrm{NN}$ does not depend on the number of interactions,
\item two nucleons are considered to interact if their transverse relative distance $d \leq \sqrt{\sigma_\mathrm{NN}/\pi}$.
\end{enumerate}

Fig.~\ref{fig:colls:centrality} illustrates an example of a Glauber Monte Carlo event for a Au+Au collision. By simulating numerous collisions, the average \Npart and \Ncoll are determined\footnote{It also shows the scaling between the numbers of participants and binary collisions, which is approximately $\Ncoll \approx 0.35 \Npart^{4/3}$ .}, and their relations to centrality and event activity observables are determined by fitting to experimental data.

Recent studies have extended the MC Glauber model to include sub-nucleonic structures. Such efforts show that the production of charged hadrons at mid-rapidity scales linearly with the number of participating partons. Comparisons with LHC data at \snnt{5.02} suggest that the number of sub-nucleonic degrees of freedom ranges from $3$ to $5$ \cite{loizides-extendedMC}.

\section{Quark-gluon plasma}

In agreement with lattice QCD predictions, the QGP has been measured in ultra-relativistic collisions of heavy nuclei at RHIC \cite{rhic-qgp}, LHC \cite{lhc-qgp}, and even SPS \cite{sps-qgp}. Although it cannot be observed directly, a wealth of evidence from three decades of research combining various observables reveals the effects of the produced QGP medium. Whilst somewhat context-dependent, the following features make QGP the most extreme phenomena observed phenomena in terms of its:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Temperature}: QGP temperatures reach values on the order of hundreds of MeV, which corresponds to approximately $2 \times 10^{12}$~K.\footnote{Contrasting some of the lowest temperatures required for the super-conducting magnets of the LHC, $T \approx 1.9$~K.}
\item \textit{Viscosity}: the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio $\eta/s$ reaches the minimum quantum limits of $1/4\pi$, making it an almost perfect liquid.
\item \textit{Vorticity}: in semi-peripheral collisions, the rotating plasma reaches a vorticity parameter of approximately $0.4$ fm$^{-1}$.
\item \textit{Magnetic field}: in non-central collisions, the magnetic fields of the heavy nuclei may peak at $\sim 10^{19}$ T.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics[width=.90\textwidth]{\imgpath/evolution.jpg}\\
\caption{TBA}
\label{fig:colls:evolution}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:colls:evolution} illustrates the mainstream paradigm of a heavy nuclei collisions evolution:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The Lorentz-contracted heavy nuclei approach each other at ultra-relativistic speeds.
\item \textit{Pre-hydrodynamisation stage} ($\tau \equiv \sqrt{t^2 - z^2} \leq 1$ fm/c): ``hard" particles are produced in scatterings with the highest momentum transfer $Q^2$, produced matter expands rapidly in longitudinal directions and starts expanding in radial direction.
\item \textit{Hydrodynamisation} ($1 \leq \tau \leq 10$ fm/c): partons are abundantly produced, creating a deconfining medium and allowing the system to be described by hydrodynamic equations.
\item \textit{Chemical freeze-out} ($\tau \sim 20$ fm/c): the cools down, hadronises, produced hadrons then stop interacting inelastically and the system's chemical content is stabilised.
\item \textit{Thermal freeze-out}: hadrons no longer interact elastically and their kinematics stabilize.
\end{enumerate}

The following subsections outline some of the essential phenomena related to the production of QGP.

\subsection{Quarkonium dissociation and sequential suppression}

Heavy quarkonia are vector mesons of $c\bar{c}$ and $b\bar{b}$. They include $J/\psi$, $\psi(2\mathrm{S})$, $\Upsilon(1\mathrm{S})$, $\Upsilon(2\mathrm{S})$, $\Upsilon(3\mathrm{S})$, which can be relatively easily measured in LHC experiments via their di-lepton decay channels. They are created solely in the first phases of the collision and then experience the entire evolution of the QGP medium:
\begin{equation}
t^{Q\overline{Q}}_\mathrm{creation} < t^\mathrm{QGP}_\mathrm{creation} < t^\mathrm{QGP}_\mathrm{lifetime} \ll t^{Q\overline{Q}}_\mathrm{lifetime} \quad .
\end{equation}

Additionally, due to their large binding energies, their radii may remain smaller than the plasma screening radius $r_\mathrm{D}(T)$, and thus, survive the dissociation. For instance, considering their in-vacuum radii determined from the $q\bar{q}$ potential, $r_{\Upsilon(1\mathrm{S})}\sim 0.14$~fm, $r_{\Upsilon(2\mathrm{S})}\sim 0.28$~fm, $r_{\Upsilon(3\mathrm{S})}\sim 0.39$~fm, which contrast the $r_\pi \sim 0.7$~fm. This implies that different temperatures result in the dissociation of different states, and measuring the production of different states can help infer QGP temperature, as illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:colls:thermometer}.

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics[width=.70\textwidth]{\imgpath/spec.eps}
\caption{TBA}
\label{fig:colls:thermometer}
\end{figure}

The production of heavy quarkonia in AA collisions is compared to that in pp collisions through the nuclear modification factor, $R_{\mathrm{AA}}$. This factor is widely used in various other AA measurements and is defined as:
\begin{align}
R_{\mathrm{AA}}=\frac{\mathrm{d}N_{\mathrm{AA}}/\mathrm{d}\pt}{\langle N_{\mathrm{coll}}\rangle\ \mathrm{d}N_{\mathrm{pp}}/\mathrm{d}\pt} \quad .
\end{align}
$R_{\mathrm{AA}}$ can take on the following values:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $R_\mathrm{AA} = 1$: There is no net effect on the production, corresponding to the absence of the QGP medium and other nuclear effects.
\item $R_\mathrm{AA} < 1$: The production is overall suppressed, for example, due to dissociation.
\item $R_\mathrm{AA} > 1$: The plasma and nuclear effects systematically enhance the measured production.
\end{enumerate}

At LHC energies, the abundance of charm quarks in the QGP is high enough that charmonia can be reformed after dissociation, which somewhat complicates the interpretation of their suppression. However, the $\Upsilon(3\mathrm{S})$ bottomonium has $R_{\mathrm{AA}}$ consistent with 0 at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}=5.02$ TeV, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:colls:cmsupsilon}. This complete suppression is a clear signature of the QGP and can be used together with models to estimate the QGP temperature at these energies as $T\approx 630$~MeV.

\subsection{Cold nuclear matter effects}

It should be noted that apart from the QGP, other effects come into play due to the fact that the collision involves two nuclei instead of two protons. These effects are important caveats to bear in mind and include:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Nuclear (anti-)shadowing: Reflects the modification in production due to differences in nPDFs and PDFs.
\item Cronin effect: Describes the initial parton energy loss due to scatterings in the nuclear medium and broadens measured \pt spectra.
\item Nuclear absorption: Describes the dissociation of particles due to their interactions with the passing-by nuclear remnants. It is generally negligible at LHC energies.
\item Co-mover absorption: This is the effect of inelastic interactions with the hadron gas.
\end{enumerate}

These effects can be isolated and quantified in pA or very peripheral AA collisions.

\section{QGP phenomena in small systems}

Measurements within the last decade have shown that certain QGP phenomena can also be observed in high-multiplicity events of pp collisions at LHC energies, which challenges the traditional assumption that QGP is only produced in AA collisions. This has sparked debates about the existence of QGP in pp collisions and, to a lesser degree, about the absence of QGP in AA collisions, despite the extensive experimental evidence.

Furthermore, the observed behavior of these phenomena indicates that the role of event multiplicity \Nch may be more significant than system size. This has led to ongoing efforts to establish a consistent and seamless link between the paradigms of pp and AA collisions.

\subsubsection{Strangeness and charm enhancement}

ALICE measurements on $\LA/\pi$, $\XI/\pi$, and $\Omega/\pi$ ratios demonstrate that the production rates of particles containing strange quarks increase faster with multiplicity than those containing only u and d quarks. This also depends on the strangeness content -- the effect is the strongest for $\Omega$ and vanishes for protons. Furthermore, the evolution to larger systems seems to be continuous with respect to \Nch. The measurements can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:colls:ssstrangeness}.

To contrast the strangeness measurements with heavier flavour, the $J/\psi \ /\pi$ ratio also shows a clear increase in yield with increasing \Nch in pp collisions, as is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:colls:ssstrangeness}. However, this comes with an important caveat: high-multiplicity events are biased to have enhanced hard processes, as discussed further in Chapter X. Moreover, the evolution of this phenomenon is also not continuous with \Nch when going from pp collisions at \sppt{13} to \snnt{5.02}, which can also be explained by the fact that charm quarks are produced solely in hard scattering processes, the rates of which depend on the collision system and center-of-mass energy.

\caption{TBA}
\label{fig:colls:ssstrangeness}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Anisotropic flow}

Measurements of azimuthal correlations and anisotropic flow in small collision systems exhibit features of a collectively expanding system, similar to those observed in heavy-ion
collisions, where they are believed to originate from the presence of QGP medium. The origin of the
collective effects depends on particle multiplicity of a collision. While hydrodynamic-like description
seems to be favored by data especially at high multiplicities, the effects of initial state effects from initial
gluon momentum correlations may play an important role at low-Nch.

\caption{TBA}
\label{fig:colls:ssv2}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Radial flow}

the ratio between Λ and K0
S
pT spectra was measured in pp interactions
characterised by different final-state multiplicities [844]. The idea behind this observable is that the radial boost of a collectively-expanding system should impact the heavier hadrons more strongly, giving
rise to the observation of an enhanced baryon-to-meson ratio at intermediate-pT. This enhancement is
observed in the Λ/K
0
S
ratio for small collision systems in a qualitatively very similar way as in heavy-ion
interactions. The magnitude of the intermediate-pT enhancement increases as the multiplicity increases
and the peak position moves towards higher values for high-multiplicity collisions, in agreement with the
hydrodynamic origin picture. Moreover, the increase at intermediate momenta is accompanied by a corresponding depletion of the ratio at low-momenta, with the integrated Λ/K
0
S
ratio exhibiting essentially
no multiplicity dependence in pp collisions. This observation also holds for proton-to-pion ratios and is
qualitatively reminiscent of what is observed in Pb–Pb collisions, as described in Sec. 2.3.2. In order to
study the low-pT depletion and mid-pT enhancement more quantitatively, specific pT regions have been
selected and the multiplicity dependence of the Λ/K
0
S
ratio in these intervals is reported in the right panel
of Fig. 82.
Similar studies have also been carried out recently for the charmed baryon-to-meson ratio Λc/D
0
, where
similar behaviour has been observed [837]. The corresponding results are shown in Fig. 82 together with
the Λ/K
0
S
ratio and exhibit a pattern consistent with the non-charmed baryon-to-meson ratio, although
future measurements with smaller uncertainties are still needed to come to a firm conclusion.

\subsubsection{Sequential suppression of Y states}

Including analysis of event
geometry via spherocity, which
suggests effect is connected
with UE not jets

As event multiplicity (should be UE) grows larger, excited Υ states are,
compared to the ground state, relatively less likely to be found 

Is it even a suppression? Maybe it’s a lower state enhancement?
àIn any case seems to be a hard – UE correlated phenomenon 

Seems we don’t understand Upsilon hadronization as it depends on the UE

Furthermore, if we consider only the events with 0 < ST < 0.55, where none or little
dependence on multiplicity is present, the mean number of charged particles per event is ex-
actly the same for the three Υ states ( 〈Ntrack
〉 = 22.4 ± 0.1). This suggests that the different
number of associated particles is not directly linked to the difference in mass between the three
states.

Important caveat here is that the hadronic decay of upsilon may result in tens of produced hadrons.

\subsubsection{Other QGP signatures}

\subsection{Role of multiplicity}

Studying the multiplicity dependence of observables described in
the previous section for pp and p–Pb collisions provides a means to explore the thresholds for QGP formation. Unlike the case for heavy-ion collisions, high multiplicity events in pp and p–Pb collisions are
not expected to result from a trivial increase in the amount of colliding matter: this is obviously the case
for pp collisions as Npart is always 2. Rather, given the initial system volume is somewhat fixed, high
multiplicity events may be associated with collisions that have energy densities exceeding the values
required for QGP formation. Indeed, the highest number of particles produced in such collisions are
comparable to peripheral heavy-ion collisions at lower energies, where QGP formation is established.

Charged-particle multiplicity appears to be the simplest, even if imperfect, event
classifier. It is a well defined measurement and allows for a direct comparison among all systems without any model dependence. Multiplicity was largely utilised by the ALICE Collaboration for event
classification in small systems 

One expects a trivial difference as the pT spectra are being measured at midrapidity in the same kinematic region where the midrapidity multiplicity selection is done. However, the slope of the pT spectra
at high-pT indicates that the midrapidity estimator selects harder and harder subnucleonic interactions as
the multiplicity increases. The ratios obtained with the forward estimator do not show a change in slope
at high-pT. Still, the hard high-pT production is more enhanced than soft low-pT production in highmultiplicity collisions and vice versa in low-multiplicity collisions. This implies that the scaling with
multiplicity of soft and hard processes is fundamentally different in pp compared to nucleus–nucleus
collisions.

a study with PYTHIA 8 (Monash 2013 tune) shows that the forward multiplicity estimator has the strongest correlation between the number of MPIs and the multiplicity. For this reason, the
forward multiplicity slicing is used for multiplicity selection in the rest of this section unless specifically noted otherwise. As the multiplicity selection is done on charged particles, a second advantage
of the forward selection is that it does not create an imbalance between charged and neutral particles at
midrapidity

Multiplicity was extensively used as an event classifier during the LHC Run 2, although it introduces
some difficulties when comparing data and theory. In fact, multiplicity cannot be directly related to the
initial energy density of the collision, and the same multiplicity in small and large collision systems can
result from completely different initial energy densities.
While the event classification studies performed during Runs 1 and 2 were highly successful, more
advanced selection strategies are being developed which will allow for a better determination of the phase
space in which several phenomena appear in small collision systems. Notably, the transverse activity
estimator RT [832] and spherocity selections [829] may shed further light on the transition between low
and high multiplicities

\section{Multiple partonic interactions}

\subsection{Color reconnection}

\section{Underlying event}

\section{Phenomenological models}

\subsection{Pythia}

\subsubsection{Ropes}

In PYTHIA, hadron production occurs via the incoherent break-up of colour flux tubes called ‘strings’,
which exhibit constant energy density, leading to the conclusion that even high-multiplicity events would
result in unchanged particle ratios. As a consequence of the observation in [487], PYTHIA modelling
had to resort to conceptually different physical mechanisms to reproduce experimental data, such as the
inclusion of ‘colour ropes’ – colour flux tubes with increased tension that are created whenever several
strings overlap prior to hadronisation in high-multiplicity pp collisions [841]. The predictions from
PYTHIA with colour ropes can be seen in Fig. 81 and describe strangeness enhancement in pp collisions
within a 10\% accuracy in high-multiplicity collisions. However, it is important to note that the proton-topion ratio is not correctly described in this model, which indicates that further theoretical studies are still
required for a proper description of hadrochemistry
